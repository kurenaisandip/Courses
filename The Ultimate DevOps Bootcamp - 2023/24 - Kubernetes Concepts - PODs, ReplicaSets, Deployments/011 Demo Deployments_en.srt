1
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:03,700
In this demo, we're going to create a deployment.

2
00:00:04,059 --> 00:00:11,980
So let us create a new folder called Deployments within our project directory and within the deployment

3
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:17,860
directory, I'm going to create a new file called called Deployment YAML.

4
00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:26,200
And we're going to make use of the definition file that we created earlier for the replica sets because

5
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:28,510
it's quite similar to that of the deployment.

6
00:00:28,510 --> 00:00:34,090
And to make this easier, we're just going to open the replica set definition file on the right.

7
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:38,020
So I'm going to use the split editor function here.

8
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:43,990
So on the left we have the deployment YAML file that we're going to create now, and on the right we

9
00:00:43,990 --> 00:00:47,260
have the replica set YAML file that we created earlier.

10
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:52,130
So as before, we will start off with the API version.

11
00:00:52,130 --> 00:00:57,740
And it is and it is also going to be API v one the same as replica set.

12
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:01,460
And I'm going to use the kind as deployment.

13
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,430
So let me select that from here.

14
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:12,920
And then the metadata, I'm going to enter it here as well, and that will have the name and labels.

15
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:20,630
And we're going to use the name as my app dash deployment.

16
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:26,040
And I will add a couple of labels as well.

17
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:38,320
The labels will be a front end to your front end and maybe another one called Engine X.

18
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:46,540
Now the spec section is very similar to that of the replica sets, so I'm just going to copy this entire

19
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:52,150
section here for the specs for the specs section and I'm just going to paste it here.

20
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:55,930
So that should be good enough for us to start the deployment.

21
00:01:55,930 --> 00:02:01,450
And I'm going to change just I'm just going to reduce the number of replicas to three.

22
00:02:02,410 --> 00:02:07,750
So let's go back to our terminal and if we check the root of our product directory, we see the new

23
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:10,389
directory that we created called deployments.

24
00:02:10,389 --> 00:02:18,850
And I'm going to create this deployment using the create command along with the dash F deployment YAML

25
00:02:18,850 --> 00:02:19,510
file.

26
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:23,230
And as you can see, the deployment has been created.

27
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:26,610
So let's run the cube.

28
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:28,680
Get deployments, Command.

29
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:37,680
And I can see that we have one deployment which is created and it has three out of three ready pods

30
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,040
and available are three as well.

31
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:43,470
So if you want to check the pod, we can run.

32
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:48,870
The cube cutter will get Pods command and I can see that we have three pods which are in the running

33
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:51,990
state which were created a few moments ago.

34
00:02:54,730 --> 00:02:57,020
Now let us run a cuddle.

35
00:02:57,190 --> 00:03:03,340
Describe deployment command and the name of the deployment is my app Dash deployment.

36
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:07,960
And here we can see a lot of similar information.

37
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:18,220
So the name of the pod, the label of the deployment itself and the the front end label that we set.

38
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:25,480
And we see the selector that we use the same as that of the replica set, which is equal to my app.

39
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:31,060
And it has three desired and three available pods and which are in a running state.

40
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:33,940
And here's the pod section.

41
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:36,370
The label of the pod is my app.

42
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:41,440
And here's the container details with the image set to engine X.

43
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:48,700
If you scroll to the bottom, you'll see that it also has an event section and it just shows the deployment

44
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:57,250
controller and message, which is that the replica set for this deployment has been scaled to three.

45
00:03:58,210 --> 00:04:05,410
And now before we move on, let's run the get all command, which shows all the objects which is created

46
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:06,100
in the cluster.

47
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:11,170
So you can see that we have one deployment, which is the deployment that we created, and there is

48
00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:18,230
a replica set which is created for that specific deployment called my app Dash replica set.

49
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:23,020
And then we have the three pods which have been created using that replica set.

50
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,750
Well, that's it for now.

51
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:29,020
Head over to the labs and try this out for yourselves.
