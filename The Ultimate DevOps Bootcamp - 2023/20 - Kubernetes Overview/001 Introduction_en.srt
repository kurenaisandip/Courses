00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:09,960
Hello and welcome to this course on Kubernetes for the Absolute Beginners.

2
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:11,620
My name is Mom Shachtman.

3
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:14,750
I'm Beth, and I will be your instructor for this course.

4
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:16,800
So about me.

5
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:22,000
I am a solutions architect and I work on cloud automation and DevOps practice.

6
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:24,720
I am also a part time trainer.

7
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:32,549
I have ordered multiple bestseller and top rated courses on Udemy, on topics like Docker and Ansible.

8
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:36,580
Let's take a look at the structure of this course.

9
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:40,630
This course contains a series of lectures on Kubernetes.

10
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:44,890
We will be discussing the basic concepts of Kubernetes here.

11
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:52,120
These are followed by some demos on setting up a test environment and getting started with Kubernetes.

12
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:57,340
We have optional quizzes that test your knowledge after each lecture.

13
00:00:57,370 --> 00:00:59,350
These are completely optional.

14
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:03,250
You don't have to pass these to continue with the course.

15
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:10,300
We then have coding exercises that will help you learn and practice developing YAML files, which will

16
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:14,470
enable you to develop Kubernetes configuration files yourself.

17
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:21,370
This configuration files may be a bit tricky for beginners, so I will also provide some tips and tricks

18
00:01:21,370 --> 00:01:24,220
that will help you remember the format.

19
00:01:24,610 --> 00:01:30,850
This, plus the coding exercises, will give you enough confidence to develop your own configuration

20
00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:31,570
files.

21
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:39,130
We will, in fact spend some extra time on these configuration files because in order to work with Kubernetes,

22
00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:42,670
you must have a good understanding around it.

23
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:48,280
At the end, you will be given an assignment to test your knowledge on the topic.

24
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:54,640
The assignment will help you gain exposure in working on a real life task with Kubernetes.

25
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:01,370
And as always, if you have any questions, you may reach out directly to me through the Q&A section.

26
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:03,610
So who is this course for?

27
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,310
This is for the absolute beginner.

28
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:11,440
You are not required to have any prior experience working with Kubernetes.

29
00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:16,480
We will walk through all the basic concepts required for you to understand Kubernetes.

30
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:21,230
This is for those who are new to containers and container orchestration technology.

31
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:27,700
You could be a developer trying to understand microservices containers and orchestration technology,

32
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:33,040
looking to gain some hands on experience in developing Kubernetes based solutions.

33
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:38,470
You could be a system admin looking to scale up your knowledge in container clusters and trying to get

34
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:42,520
some hands on experience in setting up such clusters.

35
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:49,270
Or you could be a project manager looking to gain only a basic understanding of the underlying concepts.

36
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:53,740
This is for any beginner starting his Kubernetes journey.

37
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:58,480
So that brings us to the question on how you should take up this course.

38
00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:05,080
Depending on your interest and the time and resources you have at hand, you may choose to skip certain

39
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:10,780
sections of the course if you're already familiar with the basic concepts such as Docker containers

40
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:11,960
and YAML files.

41
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:14,170
Feel free to skip those sections.

42
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:20,080
In this course we will see different ways of setting up Kubernetes on your local machine or on various

43
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:24,070
cloud platforms such as Google Cloud or AWS.

44
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:30,250
If you are in a hurry or do not have sufficient resources to set up your own instances, we will also

45
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:35,860
see option available to spin up a Kubernetes cluster in a matter of seconds on the cloud.

46
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:42,140
Moving on to the topics we will be covering in this course, we will go through the basics of Kubernetes.

47
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:46,870
We will try to understand what containers are and what container orchestration is.

48
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:51,100
We will see different ways of setting up and getting started with Kubernetes.

49
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:57,250
We will go through the various concepts such as parts, replica sets, deployments and services.

50
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:01,780
We will try and get a basic understanding of networking in Kubernetes.

51
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:09,220
We will also spend some time working with Cube, CTL, Command Line utility and developing Kubernetes

52
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:11,110
YAML to finish in files.

53
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:18,430
And finally, we will see how to deploy a microservices application on a public cloud platform like

54
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:19,390
Google Cloud.

55
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:23,980
As always, feel free to go through this course at your own pace.

56
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:30,220
There may be sections in the course that you may be familiar with already, so feel free to skip them.

57
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:34,840
So let's get started and I will see you in the first module.
