1
00:00:01,220 --> 00:00:07,580
In this demo, we're going to install a basic Kubernetes cluster using the mini cube utility as part

2
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:09,230
of this beginner's course.

3
00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:14,180
To keep things simple and easy, we will stick to Mini Cube as our lab solution.

4
00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:20,180
We explore additional options of provisioning equipment in this cluster using the cube admin tool.

5
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:22,250
In this course.

6
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:28,760
As for this course, we just want to stick to the very basics and all the basic operations can be performed

7
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:30,560
on a mini cube cluster.

8
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:37,460
So we will start at the Kubernetes i o page within this website, click on the documentation section

9
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:42,350
and navigate to tasks and install tools section.

10
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:48,620
Now, before installing mini Cube, we must install the Cube CODDLE utility.

11
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:53,420
It may be called Cube Control or Cube Cuttle or Cube CTL.

12
00:00:53,720 --> 00:01:00,260
Whatever you prefer, you might hear me mix it up at time, so bear with me on that.

13
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:08,120
So the cube command line tool is what we will use to manage our Kubernetes resources and our cluster

14
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:10,760
after it is set up using mini cube.

15
00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:18,290
Installing the cube kernel utility before installing Mini Cube will allow Mini Cube to configure the

16
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:23,270
cube puddle utility to work with the cluster when it provisions it.

17
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:31,120
So the cube utility can work with multiple clusters, local or remote clusters at the same time, and

18
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:33,320
there's a small configuration for it.

19
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:40,190
And mini Cube will automatically take care of that when it starts when it provisions a Kubernetes cluster.

20
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:44,390
But that is if you already have the cube utility installed.

21
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:45,560
So that's important.

22
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:50,360
Now, our goal is to set up a cluster on our local machine.

23
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:58,040
I'm on Linux or Ubuntu system, but the same procedure will also work on Windows or Mac operating systems

24
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:58,730
as well.

25
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:07,250
All the demos and tools that we have throughout this course will work on all operating systems Linux,

26
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:08,539
Windows or Mac.

27
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:13,640
You just need to follow the respective installation procedure for your OS.

28
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:20,690
And to start with, I'm going to install the cube kernel utility on my Linux system and we're going

29
00:02:20,690 --> 00:02:22,850
to go ahead with the latest version.

30
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:29,150
So just copy and paste the command provided here for downloading the cube kernel binary.

31
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:38,000
The binary has now been downloaded.

32
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:40,680
The next step is to make this command executable.

33
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:46,830
So I'm going to use the command mode plus X to make it executable.

34
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:52,320
And finally, we're going to move this to a location within the path user local bin.

35
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:10,340
Okay, so this way I'll be able to run this command from anywhere within my system.

36
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:22,500
So let's run the version command and you can see that it has installed the 1.18 version.

37
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:30,540
Now, what we just saw was one way of installing cube candle utility.

38
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:32,450
There are other ways to do it.

39
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:38,880
You can install it using a package manager's depending upon the type of distribution, the OS distribution

40
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:45,360
that you are on and the documentation associated with these are available here.

41
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:51,540
So if you scroll down you will see that there are instructions for installation on Mac OS and there

42
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:53,010
should be one for Windows as well.

43
00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:59,760
So make sure that you use the appropriate link and set up model based on the documentation provided.

44
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:06,540
Now that we have completed the installation of Cube model utility, we can proceed with the installation

45
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:07,740
of Mini Cube.

46
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:14,190
Now the first thing that we have to check and this goes for all operating systems Linux, Windows or

47
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:21,089
Mac, is to make sure that virtualization is enabled for your laptop or desktop wherever you're setting

48
00:04:21,089 --> 00:04:22,260
up this lab.

49
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:31,080
So one of the easy ways to make sure that virtualization is enabled on Linux is to grep for the VMAX

50
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:36,720
or the some keyword under the proc CPU info file.

51
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:38,760
So that's what I'm going to do now.

52
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:46,170
So as long as this command shows an output such as the switches listed here, virtualization has been

53
00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:50,490
enabled and you don't have to enable it specifically from the bios.

54
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:55,700
If it's not enabled, then you have to check your laptop's BIOS settings.

55
00:04:55,710 --> 00:05:00,840
So you have to restart your laptop, go into the bios, and there should be an option to enable virtualization

56
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:02,130
and you have to do that.

57
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:11,310
You might have to check your laptop's manual in order to know how that's done or just check online with

58
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:16,200
your laptop model and search how to enable virtualization on your laptop.

59
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:21,840
And again, make sure that you check the documentation here for the respective operating system that

60
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:22,710
you are on.

61
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:29,250
For each of these, there are specific commands that can be used to run a test to see whether virtualization

62
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:30,390
has been enabled.

63
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:37,050
So next we are going to install Mini Cube and again, we will go ahead with the option for Linux.

64
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:42,640
And the first prerequisite is to install Cube Cuttle, which we have already done.

65
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:45,620
The next one is to install a hypervisor.

66
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:49,680
So for Linux we can either use KVM or VirtualBox.

67
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:56,720
We will go with VirtualBox as that is our preferred virtualization solution.

68
00:05:56,730 --> 00:06:01,800
You can also run mini cube without a hypervisor and directly on your host using docker.

69
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:08,820
So if you already have Docker installed, you could leverage that and have mini Cube provisioned Kubernetes

70
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:12,180
cluster using a Docker container.

71
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:18,900
However, note that as you can see here in the documentation page, there is a warning that says it

72
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:21,570
can result in security or data loss issues.

73
00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:28,110
So we will just stick with a virtual machine based approach for now, I just prefer VirtualBox because

74
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:34,950
it can in case you mess up something on your system and you need to restart, it's easy to get rid of

75
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:36,720
the VM and restart again.

76
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:43,500
It won't really mess up your laptop and you can take snapshots before you make a major change and then

77
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:47,190
you can restore that snapshot in case that changed.

78
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:50,130
Doesn't really well work well for you.

79
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:57,190
Now, VirtualBox is supported on all variety of operating systems, including Linux, Windows and OSX.

80
00:06:57,190 --> 00:07:02,020
So I'm going to open this in a new window and it takes me to the download section.

81
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:08,050
And here I'm going to select Linux distribution and the one that is most appropriate for my system.

82
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:11,440
You may choose one that is appropriate for yours.

83
00:07:12,010 --> 00:07:17,530
So wait for it to complete the download and then we will install VirtualBox.

84
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:23,990
It has downloaded the Debian package, so I'm just going to install it directly.

85
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,700
Wait for the installation to complete.

86
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:39,440
And while it installs, let's go back to the documentation section.

87
00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:51,200
So now the installation has been completed and I'm just going to close this and I'm going to launch

88
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,250
a virtual box.

89
00:07:54,620 --> 00:08:00,500
So as you can see here, this is what the VirtualBox interface looks like and you will have a similar

90
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:05,960
interface for Windows or Mac with minor differences, but that should not matter.

91
00:08:06,530 --> 00:08:10,910
So right now we don't have any virtual machines running.

92
00:08:10,910 --> 00:08:17,600
So when we provision a cluster using mini cube, it will automatically create a virtual machine as required.

93
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:23,180
So apart from just installing VirtualBox, you don't really have to do anything directly with it.

94
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:25,990
Now let's proceed with the installation.

95
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:30,910
So the next step is to install the mini cube utility.

96
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:33,220
Again, there are different ways to do this.

97
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:40,330
Either use the package manager and install it as a package or we can do it using a direct download approach.

98
00:08:40,659 --> 00:08:45,670
So we're going to download the latest version and just like we did with the cube control utility, I'm

99
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:49,240
going to call the package and then install it on my machine.

100
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:52,240
So I'm just going to copy the whole thing.

101
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:59,140
And this will download the mini cube binaries and assign an execute bit so that we can run it as a command.

102
00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:06,190
And once that has been done, let us add Mini Cube to our path.

103
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:12,910
The user local bin directory has already been created so we don't have to do that first step.

104
00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:23,200
We will run this command.

105
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:29,370
To install mini cube at the location slash user slash local slash bin.

106
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:44,420
Next, we will provision a Kubernetes cluster using the mini cube utility.

107
00:09:45,650 --> 00:09:51,110
So we're going to run the mini cube start command, but we also have to specify the driver name to be

108
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:52,370
used with this command.

109
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:58,070
Now, Mini Cube can work with different virtualization tools, and that's where you must specify what

110
00:09:58,070 --> 00:09:59,240
driver to use.

111
00:09:59,270 --> 00:10:01,130
In our case, we use VirtualBox.

112
00:10:01,130 --> 00:10:07,520
So let's open this link and make sure that you we are using the correct driver name.

113
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:10,640
So the name of a VirtualBox driver is VirtualBox.

114
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,470
So we'll make use of that name.

115
00:10:13,010 --> 00:10:17,060
So I'm going to copy and paste this command until the driver name.

116
00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:22,100
And then I'm just going to copy the driver name from this page and paste it here.

117
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:26,110
We will now execute the command.

118
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:31,690
When it starts, you'll notice that it follows a process.

119
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:37,390
So it is, in fact downloading the ISO image for mini Cube.

120
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:44,380
And then this is the image that will be used to provision a VM on VirtualBox.

121
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:51,980
We now see that it's downloading Kubernetes version one point 18.3 and any other required binaries.

122
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:07,300
Now let me switch to the VirtualBox UI and we will see that a virtual machine by the name Mini Cube

123
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:09,820
has been created and it is in a running state.

124
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:14,380
And you can see that the VM uses two CPUs and two GB of RAM.

125
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:17,770
So let's wait for this setup to complete.

126
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:27,940
Okay, So now this has been installed and the utility is now configured to use the Kubernetes cluster

127
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:30,160
provisioned using mini cube.

128
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,800
So let's head back to the documentation page.

129
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:39,310
And the next thing that we are going to do is run the mini Cube Status Command to ensure that everything

130
00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:40,660
has been set up correctly.

131
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:46,210
So I'm going to clear the screen here and then run the mini cube status command.

132
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:55,330
We can see that the mini cube control plane, cube, black API server and cube config are all in a running

133
00:11:55,330 --> 00:11:57,640
and configured state, so that's good.

134
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:03,570
If you run into issues with the installation any time, feel free to run this command and check the

135
00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:04,260
status.

136
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,720
So our cluster is now set up.

137
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:11,040
We will deploy some applications on the cluster and make sure it's working as expected.

138
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:17,550
Now we will get into talking about the different concepts on deploying an application in the upcoming

139
00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:18,330
lectures.

140
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:25,050
Right now we just want to make sure that the cluster we set up is working as expected, so we will simply

141
00:12:25,050 --> 00:12:31,350
follow the tutorial given in this page, although it may not make total sense now, but I assure you

142
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:33,180
that we will get to that in a bit.

143
00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:36,180
So click on this link under what's next.

144
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:41,550
And here we have some examples that could be used to test our setup.

145
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:46,350
In the new page, you can skip the first step of starting a mini cube cluster.

146
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:48,660
So we have already done that.

147
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:53,490
So the next thing that we need to check is if Cube commands are working.

148
00:12:53,490 --> 00:13:00,570
So I'm going to run the cube control, get Nodes Command and you can see that it is a single node cluster

149
00:13:00,570 --> 00:13:08,040
and the node name is Mini Cube and it is in a ready state and it was spun up about 8 seconds ago and

150
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:14,760
it's running the latest release of Kubernetes, which is 1.18 as of this recording.

151
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:19,230
So next, let us try to create some deployments using this cluster.

152
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:21,600
So here we have an example on this page.

153
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:26,250
I'm going to run Cube Cuttle, Create Deployment Command to create the deployment.

154
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:42,900
Once that is done, we will run the cattle, get deployments command and you can see that the Halo mini

155
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:46,380
cube deployment has been running for 22 seconds.

156
00:13:47,130 --> 00:13:50,310
Next, we will expose this deployment as a service.

157
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:52,650
And for that, make use of this command here.

158
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:56,010
And CubeSat will expose deployment.

159
00:13:56,910 --> 00:13:58,410
Hello, Mini Cube command.

160
00:14:00,010 --> 00:14:01,810
Now, don't worry about the command for now.

161
00:14:01,810 --> 00:14:05,350
We'll talk about this in much detail later in this course.

162
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:07,270
For now, we will just copy and paste.

163
00:14:10,770 --> 00:14:11,220
Okay.

164
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:16,490
And then we will skip to step five where we will get the URL of the ex post service.

165
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,660
So by running this command.

166
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:27,130
Copy the URL and paste it into a browser on your laptop.

167
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:32,700
And it should list the details about the application like this.

168
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:39,600
Okay, so that's not the most exciting application, but this is proof that your setup is working and

169
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,250
that's all we need for now.

170
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:46,950
Now follow the remaining instructions to clean up your system, delete the services, and delete the

171
00:14:46,950 --> 00:14:47,820
deployment.

172
00:15:08,130 --> 00:15:11,840
Now the deployment will be in a terminating state for a few seconds.

173
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:21,920
And after it's done, the application will no longer be accessible on the web page.

174
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:24,610
Well, that's it for now.

175
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:27,010
And I will see you in the next lecture.
