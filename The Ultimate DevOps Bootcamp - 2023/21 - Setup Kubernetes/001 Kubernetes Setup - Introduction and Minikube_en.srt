00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,450
Hello and welcome to this lecture on setting up Kubernetes.

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:10,140
In this lecture, we will look at the various options available in building a Kubernetes cluster.

3
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:14,160
So there are a lot of ways to set up Kubernetes.

4
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:20,430
We can set it up ourselves locally on our laptops or virtual machines using solutions like mini cube

5
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:22,010
or micro rockets.

6
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:27,960
These are solutions for developers or those who want to just play around and learn Kubernetes.

7
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:34,860
The cube admin tool is used to bootstrap and manage production grade Kubernetes clusters.

8
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:41,910
There are also hosted solutions available for setting up Kubernetes in a cloud environment such as GCP,

9
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:46,530
AWS, Azure or IBM Cloud and many others.

10
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:53,070
We also have a demo on provisioning a Kubernetes cluster on GCP, and of course, these are just a few

11
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:56,520
among the many options available to deploy a Kubernetes cluster.

12
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:02,880
So you may really follow any of these approaches to set up a Kubernetes cluster.

13
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,230
But to go through this course, you don't really need to set one up.

14
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:13,770
As part of this course, we give you a real Kubernetes cluster that you can access right in your browser

15
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:17,250
with the click of a button without having to set anything up.

16
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:23,850
And we have guided challenges and fun hands on lab exercises that will get you familiar with Kubernetes

17
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:24,780
in no time.

18
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:27,210
In this section of the course.

19
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:30,060
We will just start with one of these options.

20
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:35,010
The remaining examples are in the appendix section at the end of this course.

21
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:41,700
So we will start with the mini cube option, which is the easiest way to get started with Kubernetes

22
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:42,960
on a local system.

23
00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:50,530
If Mini Cube is not of interest to you and you just want to rely on the online labs, then now would

24
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:52,330
be a good time to skip this lecture.

25
00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:57,460
So before we head into the demo, it's good to understand how it works.

26
00:01:57,850 --> 00:02:03,400
Earlier, we talked about the different components of Kubernetes that make up a master and worker node,

27
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:10,360
such as the API server, the key value store controllers and scheduler on the master and the Kubernetes

28
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:12,550
and container runtime on the worker nodes.

29
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:17,860
It will take a lot of time and effort to set up and install all of these various components on different

30
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:20,380
systems individually by ourselves.

31
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:27,580
Mini cube bundles, all of these different components into a single image, providing us a Pre-configured

32
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:32,380
single node Kubernetes cluster so we can get started in a matter of minutes.

33
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:38,800
The whole bundle is packaged into an ISO image and is available online for download.

34
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:41,280
Now.

35
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,620
You don't have to do that yourself.

36
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:50,940
Mini Cube provides an executable command line utility that will automatically download the ISO and deploy

37
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:55,950
it in a virtualization platform such as Oracle, VirtualBox or VMware Fusion.

38
00:02:56,590 --> 00:03:01,330
So you must have a hypervisor installed on your system for Windows.

39
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:07,450
You could use VirtualBox or Hyper-V and for Linux you could use VirtualBox or KVM.

40
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:14,290
And finally, to interact with the Kubernetes cluster, you must have the Cube cuttle Kubernetes command

41
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:16,720
line tool also installed on your machine.

42
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:20,370
So you need three things to get this working.

43
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:26,990
You must have a hypervisor installed, the cube cut, utility installed and mini cube executable installed

44
00:03:26,990 --> 00:03:27,890
on your system.

45
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:31,280
So we will now get into a demo.

46
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:36,260
But before that, let me quickly walk you through the hands on labs.

47
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:40,290
As I mentioned, we have hands on labs that will follow.

48
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:47,930
So once you've finished the demo, you'll see there's a quiz, and after that there's the hands on labs

49
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:49,540
and named those hands on labs.

50
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:55,520
So when you're on that lecture, you'll see a link that will take you directly to the labs hosted at

51
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,300
Code Cloud.

52
00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:03,960
So when you go to the link, when you click on the link, it'll open up the labs and so you can quickly

53
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:04,830
read through what's here.

54
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:12,330
It's basically an introduction that says so you can just click start scenario and wait for the lab to

55
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:12,990
open up.

56
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:18,890
Okay, so you'll have a terminal and access to a real Kubernetes cluster here on the left.

57
00:04:18,890 --> 00:04:21,200
And you have the quiz portal here on the right.

58
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:26,480
You can click on this this double arrow to go full screen.

59
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:29,050
That that way it's more visible.

60
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:31,740
And then you just have to go through and answer these questions.

61
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:34,410
So basically, here you have the quiz portal.

62
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:37,810
Here you have the question, read the question and try to identify the answer.

63
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:41,470
In this case, it's asking how many nodes are part of the cluster?

64
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:46,060
So by now you should know the command to get the total number of nodes.

65
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:50,430
Going to run the kip Cuddle cat nodes command.

66
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:54,600
And I see there are two.

67
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,260
So the answer is two.

68
00:04:56,280 --> 00:05:01,740
So if you're not sure what the command is, click on the hint button and here you'll get the command.

69
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:06,370
Sometimes we give you the command or some kind of hint on how to identify that.

70
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:09,930
So here you click two and that that's successful.

71
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:14,580
And here you can see the time left for this lab and the total number of questions.

72
00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:21,330
Some of these labs, we still we start with really basic and easy labs and we want to get you familiarized

73
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:22,260
with the environment.

74
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:27,830
And later on we'll have more complex labs which which will give you more experience.

75
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:33,840
And of course, in our advanced courses for the certified administrator and certified application developer

76
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:40,440
courses, we have a lot of these kind of labs and mock exams and that will help you prepare for the

77
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,040
exam.

78
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:42,600
So thank you very much.

79
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:47,790
And we will now head over to the demo where we'll see how to set up a cluster or quickly with mini Cube.
