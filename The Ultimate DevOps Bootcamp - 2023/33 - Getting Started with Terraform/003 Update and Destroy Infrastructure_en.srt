00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:08,640
In this lecture, we will learn how to update and destroy infrastructure using TerraForm.

2
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:13,820
In the previous lecture, we saw how to create a local file.

3
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:19,640
Now let us see how we can update and destroy this resource using TerraForm.

4
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:23,430
First, let us try to update this resource.

5
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:31,580
Let us add in a file permission argument to update the permission of the file to 0700 instead of the

6
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:34,250
default value of 0777.

7
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:39,500
This will remove any permission for everyone else except the owner of the file.

8
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:44,720
Now, if we run TerraForm Plan, we will see an output like this.

9
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:49,800
From the output, we can see that the resource will be replaced.

10
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:56,730
The minus plus symbol in the beginning of the resource name in the plan implies that it will be deleted

11
00:00:56,730 --> 00:00:58,350
and then recreated.

12
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:05,519
The line with the command that reads Forces replacement is responsible for the deletion and recreation.

13
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:11,490
And in this example, this is caused by the file permission argument that we added to the configuration

14
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:12,060
file.

15
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:19,200
Even though the change we made was trivial, TerraForm will delete the old file and then create a new

16
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,270
file with the updated permissions.

17
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,770
This type of infrastructure is called an immutable infrastructure.

18
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:30,210
We saw this briefly when we discussed the different types of ICC tools.

19
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:36,940
If you want to go ahead with the change, use beta form, apply command and then type.

20
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:37,300
Yes.

21
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:38,380
When prompted.

22
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:44,990
Upon confirmation the existing file is deleted and recreated with the new permissions.

23
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:50,670
To delete the infrastructure completely, run the TerraForm destroy command.

24
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:54,430
This command shows the execution plan as well.

25
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:59,710
And you can see the resource and all of its arguments have a minus symbol next to them.

26
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:03,010
This indicates that the resource will be destroyed.

27
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:05,550
To go ahead with the destroy.

28
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:06,240
Confirm?

29
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,410
Yes, in the prompt.

30
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:12,270
This will delete all the resources in the current configuration directory.

31
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:16,800
In this example, it deletes the file slash root slash pets.

32
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:16,950
Dot.

33
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:17,880
TXT.

34
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:20,600
That's it for this lecture.

35
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:26,360
Let's head over to the Hands-On Labs and practice updating and deleting infrastructure resources using

36
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,050
TerraForm.
