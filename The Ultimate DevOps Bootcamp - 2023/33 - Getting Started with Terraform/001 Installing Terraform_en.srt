1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,840
In this section, we will learn how to install TerraForm.

2
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:12,270
TerraForm can be downloaded as a single binary or an executable file from the TerraForm download section

3
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:13,740
in w w w.

4
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:15,010
Dot terraform i.

5
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:15,300
O.

6
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:22,110
Installing their form is as simple as downloading this file and copying it to the system path.

7
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:23,950
Once installed.

8
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:28,540
We can check the version by running the command TerraForm version.

9
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:37,050
The latest version of TerraForm as of this recording is 0.13 and will be making use of this version

10
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:38,250
throughout the course.

11
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:45,200
TerraForm is supported on Windows, Mac and several other Linux based distributions.

12
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:52,110
Please note that all the examples and labs used in this course will make use of TerraForm running on

13
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:56,250
a Linux machine and specifically the version 0.13.

14
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:57,990
And that's it.

15
00:00:57,990 --> 00:01:00,900
We can now start deploying resources using TerraForm.

16
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:08,220
As stated earlier, TerraForm uses configuration files which are written in SQL to deploy infrastructure

17
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:09,090
resources.

18
00:01:09,910 --> 00:01:17,650
These files have a dot F extension and can be created using any text editor such as notepad or notepad

19
00:01:17,650 --> 00:01:23,440
plus plus for windows or command line text editors such as Vim or Mac in Linux.

20
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:26,110
Or it could be any ID of your choice.

21
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:29,530
So what is the resource?

22
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:32,650
A resource is an object that therefore manages.

23
00:01:32,890 --> 00:01:38,530
It could be a file on a local host, or it could be a virtual machine on the cloud, such as an easy

24
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:38,710
to.

25
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:39,520
Instance.

26
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:44,950
Or it could be services like SSE three buckets x Dynamo db tables.

27
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:49,330
I am users or I am groups, roles, policies, etc..

28
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:57,410
Or it could be resources on major cloud providers such as the Compute and app engine from GCP databases

29
00:01:57,410 --> 00:02:00,500
on Azure, Azure Active Directory, etc..

30
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:07,260
There are literally hundreds of resources that can be provisioned across most of the cloud and on premise

31
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:09,150
infrastructure using TerraForm.

32
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:14,550
We will look into some of these examples later in this course.

33
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:21,300
But for the first few sections, we will stick to two very easy to understand resources, the local

34
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:26,130
file type of resource, and a special kind of resource called a random pit.

35
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:32,400
It is important to use a simple resource type to really understand the basics of TerraForm, such as

36
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:39,900
the lifecycle of resources, the SQL format, etc. Once we gain a good understanding of the basics,

37
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:46,110
we can easily apply that knowledge to other real life use cases and we will see that in later sections

38
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:47,100
of this course.
