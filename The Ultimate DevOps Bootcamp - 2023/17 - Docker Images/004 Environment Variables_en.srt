00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:08,910
Let us start with a simple web application written in Python.

2
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:15,120
This piece of code is used to create a web application that displays a web page with a background color.

3
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:21,120
If you look closely into the application code, you will see a line that sets the background color to

4
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:21,450
red.

5
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:23,780
Now, that works just fine.

6
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:29,580
However, if you decide to change the color in the future, you will have to change the application

7
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:30,210
code.

8
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:37,140
It is a best practice to move such information out of the application code and into, say, an environment

9
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:39,390
variable called app color.

10
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:45,980
The next time you run the application, set an environment variable called add color to a desired value,

11
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:48,600
and the application now has a new color.

12
00:00:49,490 --> 00:00:55,640
Once your application gets packaged into a Docker image, you will then run it with the Docker run command,

13
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:57,740
followed by the name of the image.

14
00:00:57,980 --> 00:01:04,400
However, if you wish to pass the environment variable as we did before, you would now use the Docker

15
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:12,290
run commands option to set an environment variable within the container to deploy multiple containers

16
00:01:12,290 --> 00:01:13,610
with different colours.

17
00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:19,520
You would run the Docker command multiple times and set a different value for the environment variable

18
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:20,420
each time.

19
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:27,140
So how do you find the environment variable set on a container that's already running?

20
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:32,570
Use the Docker, inspect command to inspect the properties of a running container.

21
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:38,660
Under the config section you will find the list of environment variables set on the container.

22
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:43,730
Well, that's it for this lecture on configuring Environment Variables in Docker.
