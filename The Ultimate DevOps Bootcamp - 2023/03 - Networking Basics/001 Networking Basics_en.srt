1
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:06,070
In this series of lectures, we get our networking basics right.

2
00:00:06,730 --> 00:00:12,310
We look at basic networking concepts like switching, routing, gateways, etc..

3
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:14,650
We then understand DNS.

4
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:20,680
We look at how to configure DNS settings on a Linux system.

5
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:22,360
So let's get started.

6
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:25,650
So what is a network?

7
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:31,860
We have two computers A and B, laptops, desktops, VMs on the cloud, wherever.

8
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:34,920
How does System A reach B?

9
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:41,730
We connect them to a switch, and the switch creates a network containing the two systems to connect

10
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:42,860
them to a switch.

11
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:50,550
We need an interface on each host, physical or virtual, depending on the host, to see the interfaces

12
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:54,150
for the host, we use the IP link command.

13
00:00:54,510 --> 00:01:01,230
In this case, we look at the interface named E zero that we will be using to connect to the switch.

14
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:04,440
Let's assume it's a network with the address.

15
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:07,020
One 92.1 60 8.1.0.

16
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:11,550
We then assign the systems with IP addresses on the same network.

17
00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:15,480
For this we use the command IP HDR.

18
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:22,400
Once the links are up and the IP addresses are assigned, the computers can now communicate with each

19
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,200
other through the switch.

20
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:31,960
The switch can only enable communication within a network, which means it can receive packets from

21
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:37,810
a host on the network and deliver it to other systems within the same network.

22
00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:46,550
So we have another network containing systems C and D at address 190 2.1682.0.

23
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:52,700
The systems have IP address 192 168 2.10 and 2.11 respectively.

24
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:57,710
How does a system in one network reach a system in the other?

25
00:01:57,860 --> 00:02:07,970
How does system B with the IP one 92.1 68 1.11 Read System C with the IP 2.10 on the other network.

26
00:02:08,389 --> 00:02:10,580
That's where a router comes in.

27
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:15,440
A router helps connect two networks together.

28
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:17,700
It is an intelligent device.

29
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:21,710
So think of it as another server with many network ports.

30
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:29,990
Since it connects to the two separate networks, it gets two IPS assigned one on each network.

31
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:38,180
In the first network, we assign it an IP address, 192 168 1.1 and in the second we assign it an IP

32
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:39,410
2.1.

33
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:45,170
Now we have a router connected to the two networks that can enable communication between them.

34
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:53,460
When System B tries to send a packet to system C, how does it know where the router is on the network?

35
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:59,230
To send the packet through the router is just another device on the network.

36
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:02,320
There could be many other such devices.

37
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:08,930
That's where we configure the systems with a gateway or a route.

38
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:16,310
If the network was a room, the gateway is a door to the outside world, to the other networks or to

39
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:17,150
the Internet.

40
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:25,670
The systems need to know where that door is, to go through that, to see the existing routing configuration

41
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:28,730
on a system run the route command.

42
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:31,400
It displays the colonel's routing table.

43
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:36,650
And within that, as you can see, there are no routing configurations as of now.

44
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:41,870
So in this condition, your system B will not be able to reach system C.

45
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:49,220
It can only reach other systems within the same network in the range 192 to 1 68 to 1.0.

46
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:58,580
To configure a gateway on system B to reach the systems on network 2.0, run the IP route ad command

47
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:06,740
and specify that you can reach the one 92.1 60 8.2.0 network through the door or Gateway at one 92.1

48
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:08,450
60 8.1.1.

49
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:16,880
Running the route command again shows that we have a route added to reach the 18216820 series network

50
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:17,899
through the router.

51
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:23,010
Now, remember, this has to be configured on all the systems.

52
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:30,030
For example, if the system C is to send a packet to system B, then you need to add a route on system

53
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:36,540
C's routing table to access the network at 1.0 through the router configured with the IP address.

54
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:37,650
2.1.

55
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:47,400
Now, suppose these systems need access to the Internet, so they need access to Google At one 72.2

56
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:50,340
17 to 1 94.0 network on the Internet.

57
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:56,880
So you connect the router to the Internet and then add a new route in your routing table to route all

58
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,380
traffic to the network.

59
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:02,370
One 72.2 17.1 94 through your router.

60
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:07,510
There are so many different sites on different networks on the Internet.

61
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:13,980
Instead of adding a routing table entry for the same routers IP address for each of those networks,

62
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:21,970
you can simply say for any network that you don't know a route to use this router as the default gateway.

63
00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:29,290
This way, any request to any network outside of your existing network goes to this particular router.

64
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:37,250
So in a simple setup like this, all you need is a single routing table entry with the default gateway

65
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:39,200
set to the Router's IP address.

66
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:45,180
Remember instead of the word default, you could also say 0.0.0.0.

67
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:47,670
It means any IP destination.

68
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:53,220
Both of these lines mean the same thing is 0.0000.

69
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:59,130
Entry in the gateway field indicates that you don't need a gateway, for example, in this case for

70
00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:04,860
system C to access any devices in the 192168220 network.

71
00:06:04,890 --> 00:06:08,640
It doesn't need a gateway because it is in its own network.

72
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:13,740
But say you have multiple routers in your network, one for the internet.

73
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,930
Another for the internal private network.

74
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:22,700
Then you will need to have two separate entries for each network.

75
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:29,930
One entry for the internal private network and another entry with the default gateway for all other

76
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:32,300
networks, including public networks.

77
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:38,450
So if you're having issues reaching Internet from your systems, this routing table and the default

78
00:06:38,450 --> 00:06:41,690
gateway configuration is a good place to start.

79
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:47,340
Let us now look at how we can set up a Linux host as a router.

80
00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:49,380
Let's start with a simple setup.

81
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:51,360
I have three hosts.

82
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:52,500
A, B, and C.

83
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:54,720
A and B are connected to a network.

84
00:06:54,720 --> 00:07:00,240
190 21681 and B and C to another on 190 to 1 68.2.

85
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:06,150
So host B is connected to both the networks using two interfaces eight zero and eight one.

86
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:18,110
He has IP 1921681.5 see has 182 168 2.5 and B has an IP on both the networks 1.6 and 2.6.

87
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:21,520
How do we get a to talk to see?

88
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:27,610
But basically, if I try to paint 2.5 from a it would say network is unreachable.

89
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,760
And by now we know why that is.

90
00:07:29,770 --> 00:07:35,950
Host A has no idea how to reach a network at 192 to 1 68.2.

91
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:44,950
We need to tell host a that the door or gateway to network two is through host B and we do that by adding

92
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:46,330
air routing table entry.

93
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:55,690
We add a route to access network one 92.1 68.2, while the Gateway 192 168 1.6.

94
00:07:56,540 --> 00:08:03,500
If the packets were to get through to host C host C will have to send back responses to host A.

95
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:12,120
When host c tries to reach host a at 1921681 network, it would face the same issue.

96
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:19,230
So we need to let host C know that it can reach host A through host b which is acting as a router.

97
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:23,090
So we add a similar entry into host C routing table.

98
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:31,440
This time we say to reach network 182 168 1.0 Talk to host B at 1 to 168 2.6.

99
00:08:32,659 --> 00:08:37,970
When we try to ping now, we no longer get the network unreachable error message.

100
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:43,750
That means our routing entries are right, but we still don't get any response back.

101
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:50,310
By default in Linux packets are not forwarded from one interface to the next.

102
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:58,390
For example, packets received on E zero on host B are not forwarded to elsewhere through it.

103
00:08:58,410 --> 00:08:59,160
One.

104
00:08:59,890 --> 00:09:01,980
This is this way for security reasons.

105
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:07,930
For example, if you had it's zero connected to your private network and either one to a public network,

106
00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:14,080
we don't want anyone from the public network to easily send messages to the private network unless you

107
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,820
explicitly allow that.

108
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:20,800
But in this case, since we know that both are private networks and it is safe to enable communication

109
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:26,500
between them, we can allow host B to forward packets from one network to the other.

110
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:34,930
Whether a host can forward packets between interfaces is governed by a setting in this system at file

111
00:09:34,930 --> 00:09:36,280
proxies.

112
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:40,420
Net IPV four IP underscore forward.

113
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:46,180
By default, the value in this file is set to zero, meaning no forward.

114
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:49,570
Set this to one and you should see the pings go through.

115
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:53,890
Now, remember, simply setting this value does not persist.

116
00:09:53,890 --> 00:09:55,550
The changes across reboots.

117
00:09:55,570 --> 00:10:01,600
For that you must modify the same value in the same size control action file.

118
00:10:03,090 --> 00:10:06,180
So let's take away some key commands from this lecture.

119
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:08,730
This will be handy in the upcoming lectures.

120
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:14,040
IP link is to list and modify interfaces on the host IP.

121
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:19,260
DDR Command is to see the IP addresses assigned to those interfaces.

122
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:24,930
IP ADR AD Command is used to set IP addresses on the interfaces.

123
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:30,000
Now remember, changes made using these commands are only valid until a restart.

124
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:33,840
If you want to persist these changes, you must set them in.

125
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:36,360
The ETSI Network interfaces file.

126
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:44,590
IP route or simply the route command is used to view the routing table and IP route AD command is used

127
00:10:44,590 --> 00:10:46,900
to add entries into the routing table.

128
00:10:46,990 --> 00:10:52,740
And finally, remember the command to check if IP forwarding is enabled on a host.

129
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:57,880
If you are working with a host configured as a router, well, the server for this lecture.

130
00:10:57,910 --> 00:11:01,900
In the next lecture we will discuss about DNS configurations.
