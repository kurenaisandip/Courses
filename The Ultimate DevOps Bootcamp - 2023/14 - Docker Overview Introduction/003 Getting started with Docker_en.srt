1
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:07,620
We will now see how to get started with Docker.

2
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:12,930
Now Docker has two editions, the Community Edition and the Enterprise edition.

3
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:17,060
The community edition is the set of free Docker products.

4
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:23,280
The Enterprise edition is the certified and supported container platform that comes with enterprise

5
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:29,970
add ons like the Image Management Image Security, Universal Control Plan for managing and orchestrating

6
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:31,170
container runtimes.

7
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:33,600
But of course these come with a price.

8
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:39,960
We will discuss more about container orchestration later in this course and along with some alternatives.

9
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:43,830
For now, we will go ahead with the community edition.

10
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:52,320
The community edition is available on Linux, Mac Windows or on cloud platforms like AWS or Azure.

11
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:58,800
In the upcoming demo, we will take a look at how to install and get started with Docker on a Linux

12
00:00:58,800 --> 00:00:59,460
system.

13
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:04,200
Now, if you are on Mac or Windows, you have two options.

14
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:11,310
Either install a Linux VM using VirtualBox or some kind of virtualization platform and then follow along

15
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:16,230
with the upcoming demo, which is really the most easiest way to get started with Docker.

16
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:23,490
The second option is to install Docker desktop for Mac or Docker desktop for Windows, which are native

17
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:24,450
applications.

18
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:31,140
So if that is really what you want to take out the Docker for Mac and the Windows sections towards the

19
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:35,400
end of this course and then head back here once you are all set up.

20
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:42,600
We will now head over to a demo and we will take a look at how to install Docker on a Linux machine.
