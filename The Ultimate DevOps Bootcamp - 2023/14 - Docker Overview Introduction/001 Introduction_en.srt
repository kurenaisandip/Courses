00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:13,020
Hello and welcome to the Docker for Beginners Course.

2
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:17,430
My name is Moonchild Manabat and I will be your instructor for this course.

3
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:24,090
I'm a DevOps and cloud trainer at Code Icloud.com, which is an interactive hands on online learning

4
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:24,870
platform.

5
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:31,230
I've been working in the industry as a consultant for over 13 years and have helped hundreds of thousands

6
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:35,280
of students learn technology in a fun and interactive way.

7
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:41,730
In this course, you will learn Docker through a series of lectures that use animation illustration

8
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:45,810
and some fun analogies that simplify complex concepts.

9
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:51,390
We have demos that will show you how to install and get started with Docker, and most importantly,

10
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:55,500
we have hands on labs that you can access right in your browser.

11
00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:57,670
I will explain more about it in a bit.

12
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:00,900
But first, let's look at the objectives of this course.

13
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:07,080
In this course we first try to understand what containers are, what Docker is, and why you might need

14
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:08,820
it and what it can do for you.

15
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:13,730
We will see how to run a Docker container, how to build your own Docker image.

16
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:19,980
We will see networking in Docker and how to use Docker compose what Docker registry is, how to deploy

17
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:21,570
your own private registry.

18
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:27,300
And we then look at some of these concepts in depth and we try to understand how Docker really works

19
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:28,230
under the hood.

20
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:35,250
We look at Docker for Windows and Mac before finally getting a basic introduction to container orchestration

21
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:38,370
tools like Docker Swarm and Kubernetes.

22
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,650
Here's a quick note about Hands on Labs.

23
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:44,820
First of all, to complete this course, you don't have to set up your own labs.

24
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:49,380
Well, you may set it up if you wish to, if you wish to have your own environment.

25
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:50,990
And we have a demo as well.

26
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:57,570
But as part of this course, we provide real labs that you can access right in your browser anywhere,

27
00:01:57,570 --> 00:02:00,060
anytime, and as many times as you want.

28
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:06,600
The labs give you instant access to a terminal to a docker host and an accompanying quiz portal.

29
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:12,540
The quiz portal asks a set of questions such as exploring the environment and gathering information,

30
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:17,100
or you might be asked to perform an action such as running Docker Container.

31
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:21,900
The quiz portal then validates your work and gives you feedback instantly.

32
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:28,530
Every lecture in this course is accompanied by such challenging interactive quizzes that makes learning

33
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:34,890
Docker a fun activity, so I hope you're as thrilled as I am to get started.

34
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:36,060
So let us begin.
