1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:04,710
In this demo, we look at how to install and get started with Docker.

2
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:11,430
First of all, identify a system, physical or virtual machine or laptop that has a supported operating

3
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:12,120
system.

4
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:14,610
In my case I have an ubuntu VM.

5
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:17,670
Go to docs dot docker dot com.

6
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:21,150
And click on Get Darker.

7
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:25,880
You will be taken to the Docker Engine Community Edition page.

8
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:28,910
That is the free version that we are after.

9
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:31,850
From the left hand menu.

10
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:33,870
Select your system type.

11
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:39,520
I chose Linux in my case and then select your OS flavor.

12
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:41,060
I choose Ubuntu.

13
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,510
Read through the prerequisites and requirements.

14
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:52,940
Your ubuntu system must be 64 bit and one of the supported versions like disco, cosmic, bionic or

15
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:53,660
senile.

16
00:00:54,230 --> 00:00:58,700
In my case, I have a bionic version to confirm.

17
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:01,610
View the ETSI release file.

18
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:08,180
Next uninstall any older versions if one exists.

19
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:12,410
So let's just make sure that there is none on my host.

20
00:01:12,410 --> 00:01:14,900
So I'll just copy and paste that command.

21
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:20,420
And I confirm that there are no older version that exists on my system.

22
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:25,950
The next step is to set up repository and install the software.

23
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:28,900
Now, there are two ways to go about this.

24
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:36,650
The first is using the package manager by first updating the repository using the app git update command,

25
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:43,080
then installing the prerequisite packages and then adding dockers official GPG keys and then installing

26
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:43,740
docker.

27
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:46,110
But I'm not going to go that route.

28
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:48,090
There is an easier way.

29
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:54,300
If you scroll all the way to the bottom, you will find the instructions to install Docker using the

30
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:55,650
convenience script.

31
00:01:56,540 --> 00:02:02,570
It's a script that automates the entire installation process and works on most operating systems.

32
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:09,650
Run the first command to download a copy of the script and then run the second command to execute the

33
00:02:09,650 --> 00:02:12,680
script to install Docker automatically.

34
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:15,620
Give it a few minutes to complete the installation.

35
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:25,400
The installation is now successful.

36
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:30,110
Let us now check the version of Docker using the Docker version command.

37
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:33,980
We've installed version 19.0 3.1.

38
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:40,090
We will now run a simple container to ensure everything is working as expected.

39
00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:41,410
For this.

40
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,830
Head over to Docker Hub at Hub.

41
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:45,190
Docker dot com.

42
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:53,260
Here you will find a list of the most popular Docker images like Engine X, MongoDB, Alpine, Node.js,

43
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:54,580
Redis, etc..

44
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:58,210
Let's search for a fun image called We'll See.

45
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:06,280
We'll say is Docker version of Cows, which is basically a simple application that trains a cow saying

46
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:06,940
something.

47
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:13,300
In this case, it happens to be a will copy the Docker run command given here.

48
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:19,420
Remember to add sudo and we will change the message to Hello world.

49
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,280
On running this command.

50
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:45,260
Docker pulls the image of the Wales application from Docker Hub and runs it, and we have our Vale saying

51
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:46,070
Hello.

52
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:47,220
Great.

53
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:48,870
We're all set.

54
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:54,410
Remember, for the purpose of this course, you don't really need to set up a Docker system on your

55
00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:54,860
own.

56
00:03:55,100 --> 00:04:00,920
We provide hands on labs that you will get access to, but if you wish to experiment on your own and

57
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:02,900
follow along, feel free to do so.
