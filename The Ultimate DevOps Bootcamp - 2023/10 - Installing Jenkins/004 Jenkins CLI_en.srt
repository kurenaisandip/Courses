00:00:04,190 --> 00:00:08,210
When you first install Jenkins, you're going to have a bunch of different things that you can do in

2
00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:11,510
the UI, and we're definitely going to go over all of that good stuff.

3
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:14,000
But there is also a CLI.

4
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:19,910
So if you prefer to work out of the terminal instead of clicking around a UI, Jenkins does have a built

5
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:25,900
in command line interface that we can use and we can connect to it via curl.

6
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:31,940
And if we scroll down here we can actually see that there is an authentication method here that we can

7
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:35,000
use to get into the server.

8
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:40,430
So from the portal here, if I click on my name and I go to configure.

9
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:46,810
And I scroll down here, I have a few different options, like an API token, for example, credentials,

10
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:47,290
email.

11
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:52,720
This is just a fake email here, but if I keep going down, I have ssh keys.

12
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:58,540
So if I wanted to, I could take an SSH key, a public one, and pop it in here.

13
00:00:58,540 --> 00:01:07,210
So for example, if I type cat ID RSA dot pub, this is my public ssh key on my Mac.

14
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:15,760
So if I go ahead and if I copy that, then I paste that in here, I click Save and I go back to configure,

15
00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:16,900
scroll down.

16
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:25,600
I now have a public ssh key associated with my user Mike, and now I can work on the terminal via the

17
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:26,590
Jenkins CLI.

18
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:32,020
Now I will admit that you probably won't see people working on the CLI all that much.

19
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:37,210
It's going to be more or less throughout the UI and a lot of the courses that you see as well.

20
00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:44,230
But if you want to now that you're authenticated, you can start working with the Jenkins CLI and using

21
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:46,570
the different common commands and all that good stuff.

22
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:49,910
Well, that's it for this lecture.

23
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,390
We'll see you in the next.
