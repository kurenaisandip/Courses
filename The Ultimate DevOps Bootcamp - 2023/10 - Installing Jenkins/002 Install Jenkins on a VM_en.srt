1
00:00:03,830 --> 00:00:09,230
All right, everybody, let's go ahead and dive into what it's going to look like to install Jenkins

2
00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:09,900
on a beam.

3
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:15,560
Now, we will be using a boon to and again, I'm going to be using Azure, But you could use anything

4
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:18,020
like you could use Hyper-V locally.

5
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:24,230
You could use an A boon to server ISO that you download from a website.

6
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:25,940
You could really use anything.

7
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:29,900
But for me it's just easier to just spin up a quick VM in Azure.

8
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:31,610
So that's what we're going to be doing today.

9
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:38,240
So first things first, I'm just going to go to virtual machines and I'm going to click Create Virtual

10
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:38,780
Machine.

11
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:44,810
Now you can skip this step if you want to, although it may actually be helpful for you to see the resources

12
00:00:44,810 --> 00:00:48,140
that I'm using like RAM and CPU and stuff like that.

13
00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:53,620
So I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to just choose my Code Cloud Resource group.

14
00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:59,090
I'm going to give it a name, I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to choose a boon to 24.

15
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:02,000
And go ahead.

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,340
And I'm going to choose the size that I want.

17
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:08,240
So it's going to be one CPU and two gigs of memory.

18
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:10,670
Fairly small, fairly cheap.

19
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:15,050
Next, I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to set up a password here, and that's just going to be the

20
00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:17,510
username and password to SSH into the server.

21
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:20,570
I'm going to allow Port 22 to be open.

22
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:22,520
Definitely don't do this in production.

23
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:24,680
I'm just doing this because it's a demo environment.

24
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:29,990
But really what this is saying is I'm going to be able to hit the server from any IP, no firewall rules

25
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:31,730
or security groups or anything or present.

26
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,070
For discs.

27
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:36,230
It's going to be a premium SSD.

28
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:42,440
I'm going to go ahead and put it into this code Cloud V Net and click next review.

29
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:44,300
I just had to redo the password there.

30
00:01:44,330 --> 00:01:47,510
Now I can go ahead and create my VM.

31
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:49,520
So I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to create this VM.

32
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:52,610
And then once it's done, I'll go ahead and open it up in a terminal.

33
00:01:53,150 --> 00:02:00,920
So I have my terminal here and what I'm going to do is I'm going to type SSH mike at IP address.

34
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:04,640
This is the public IP address of my virtual machine.

35
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:07,550
Let me go ahead and I'm going to click.

36
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:08,720
Yes.

37
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:11,480
I'm going to type in my password.

38
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:15,650
Okay.

39
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:19,220
And now we are officially inside of the server.

40
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:20,960
So I'm going go ahead and I'm going to clear this.

41
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:24,780
First thing that I'm going to do is run sudo apt update minus y.

42
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,630
This is just to update the server here.

43
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:32,290
And then next, I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to run my prerequisite.

44
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:36,860
Now, really, the only prerequisite that I need is to install Java.

45
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:39,250
So I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to install Java.

46
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:49,270
And now that our prerequisite is installed, we are ready to start installing Jenkins.

47
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:55,570
First things first, we're going to go ahead and we're going to add the repository key to the system.

48
00:02:56,790 --> 00:03:02,100
Next, we're going to go ahead and we're going to append the package repository to the server source

49
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:02,730
list.

50
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:09,060
Essentially, what that means is we are taking the Jenkins repo and we're adding it to our aptitude

51
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:10,050
package manager.

52
00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:15,480
Next, we're going to go ahead and we're going to run sudo apt update minus y.

53
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:21,300
And the reason why is because it's now embedding that jenkins repo or package inside of our package

54
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:26,720
manager and then we'll be ready to actually install Jenkins.

55
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:28,590
So let's go ahead and do that.

56
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:36,150
And just like that, Jenkins is installed very straightforward.

57
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:41,210
Now all we have to really do is start Jenkins and ensure that we can reach the server.

58
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:46,310
So let's go ahead and do that by running our start command.

59
00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:49,650
You got to put the s in front of that.

60
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:52,980
And what this is going to do is it's going to actually start the service.

61
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:58,020
Next, we're going to go ahead and we're going to run system CTL status.

62
00:03:58,020 --> 00:04:02,940
Jenkins We can see that it is, in fact active and running.

63
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:06,300
And then now we're going to go ahead and we're going to open up the firewall.

64
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:12,420
So what that's going to do is it's going to allow us to interact with Jenkins from the UI and it needs

65
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:13,830
port 80, 80 open.

66
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:16,680
So we're going to go ahead and we're going to allow that.

67
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:21,390
We can go ahead and we can run the firewall status here.

68
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:27,610
And we can see that it is in fact inactive, which is perfectly fine.

69
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:31,540
So next I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to hit exit there.

70
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:34,090
I'm going to copy this IP address.

71
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:35,220
And then I'm going to go ahead.

72
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:37,090
I'm going to open up our Web browser.

73
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:40,210
We're going to type this in.

74
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:44,860
And we should be able to access Jenkins.

75
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:48,040
And if we can, I'll tell you exactly why.

76
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:55,600
If we go to the Azure portal and we go to networking, the port may not be open.

77
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:59,980
So let's go ahead and add the source port range of any.

78
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:01,510
The destination is any.

79
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:03,900
The destination port range is four 8080.

80
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:08,230
Then we're going to go ahead and we're going to give this a name port 8080 there.

81
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:11,530
So now it's creating our security rule here.

82
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:15,160
That way we can access our server on Port 8080.

83
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:19,390
And now we are officially good to go here.

84
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:25,180
Now to actually unlock Jenkins, we have a password that we need to hit and that password is on our

85
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:25,840
server.

86
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:31,270
And the way that we do that is we run sudo cat var lib jenkins.

87
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:34,900
This is where our Jenkins application or package lives secrets.

88
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:37,330
And then there's an initial admin password.

89
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:40,160
That's going to be this password right here.

90
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:41,750
I'm going to go ahead and copy that.

91
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:44,420
Go back to Jenkins.

92
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:47,430
I run that.

93
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:52,600
And then as we can see, our server is officially up and running.

94
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:57,340
And what we can do is we can install the suggested plugins and we'll go ahead and we'll wait for this

95
00:05:57,340 --> 00:05:58,180
to finish.

96
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:02,050
And then once it's finished, it'll come up to our Jenkins UI.

97
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:05,880
Now we're going to go ahead and we're going to create our first admin user.

98
00:06:05,890 --> 00:06:10,120
So I'll just say, Mike, give it a password here.

99
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:14,090
Give it.

100
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:22,050
And full name.

101
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,040
We have our Jenkins Earl here.

102
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:31,540
Now, if we had a dense address, we could obviously pass that in here, but we don't at the moment.

103
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:34,270
So we'll just go ahead and we'll keep it as the IP address.

104
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:38,440
We'll go ahead and click, save and finish start using Jenkins.

105
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:43,940
And we are officially at the portal.

106
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:46,420
All right, everybody.

107
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:47,880
That's it for this lecture.

108
00:06:47,890 --> 00:06:51,160
Head over to the labs and start practicing what you've just learned.
