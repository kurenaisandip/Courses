00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:07,270
In this section, we're going to talk about what it looks like to install Jenkins.

2
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:13,710
Now, you're going to be pretty pleasantly surprised that it doesn't take all that much to get Jenkins

3
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:14,490
up and running.

4
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:17,860
It's a few lines on the terminal.

5
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:21,030
Open up a port and that's pretty much it.

6
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:26,520
So our environment is we're going to be installing Jenkins on a boon to 20.4.

7
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:30,450
Now I will be running that virtual machine inside of Azure.

8
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:31,530
Don't worry.

9
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:32,990
You don't need Azure.

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:40,020
You could use AWS, you could use GCP, you could use a virtual machine running locally on your desktop

11
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:41,100
or your laptop.

12
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:42,600
It totally doesn't matter.

13
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:45,900
I'm just running it in Azure because it's easy.

14
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:52,980
So we're going to install Jenkins fully on a boon to and we're going to install all of the dependencies

15
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:55,440
that are needed to get Jenkins up and running.

16
00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:00,840
And then once we do that, we'll be able to log into the Jenkins portal, see all the visuals and start

17
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:03,600
to play around and get on our journey.

18
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:07,040
Well, that's it for this lecture.

19
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:08,490
We'll see you in the next.
