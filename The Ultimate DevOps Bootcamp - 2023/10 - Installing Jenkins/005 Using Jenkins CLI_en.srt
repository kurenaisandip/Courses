1
00:00:03,310 --> 00:00:07,960
All right, everybody, now that we understand a little bit about the Jenkins clay, what it does,

2
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:09,780
let's go ahead and learn how to use it.

3
00:00:09,790 --> 00:00:12,070
So I'm at my Jenkins portal right now.

4
00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:15,580
And what I'm going to do is I'm going to click on Manage Jenkins.

5
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:21,070
Now, if I scroll all the way down here, notice how under tools and actions I have Jenkins CLI.

6
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:22,480
Let's go ahead and click on that.

7
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:28,420
Now, this does show a little bit of a piece of documentation stating what you can do to get up and

8
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:29,320
running and all of that.

9
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:32,910
But let's go through from an authentication perspective.

10
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:38,350
So first things first, let's go ahead and install the Jenkins cloud.

11
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:41,110
So I'm going to open up my terminal here and I'm on my Jenkins host.

12
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:45,910
Notice I'm going to run a command against the Jenkins Cloud jar.

13
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:51,330
Now, if I lose here, we'll see that I have my Jenkins Clyde dot jar.

14
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:55,800
Now we have to authenticate to Jenkins from here.

15
00:00:55,800 --> 00:01:00,220
Even though yes, we are on the Jenkins host, we still have to authenticate to Jenkins.

16
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:05,790
Now, the way that we can do that is if I go ahead and I open up another Jenkins portal here, I'm going

17
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:11,790
to go to manage actually, rather under my name here, I'm going to click on configure.

18
00:01:12,610 --> 00:01:15,990
And then I'm going to go to API tokens.

19
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,110
Now, under here, as you can see, I already have an API token created.

20
00:01:20,110 --> 00:01:26,380
You may not, which is okay, all you have to do is just click add new token and the new token will

21
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:28,450
pop up when I click generate here.

22
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:31,450
And as you can see, I have a new token right here.

23
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:36,700
So now that I have the token, I can authenticate to Jenkins.

24
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:38,320
And how do we do that?

25
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:41,050
Well, let's go ahead and open up our terminal here again.

26
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:45,880
And as you can see, I'm running the Java Jar Jenkins command.

27
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,130
I'm specifying my URL here.

28
00:01:48,130 --> 00:01:50,500
And now I have this auth argument.

29
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:54,490
And what the auth argument does is I pass in my username.

30
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:58,240
Colon, then my API token.

31
00:01:58,510 --> 00:02:00,700
So I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to run that.

32
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:07,240
And boom, as we can see, we get a whole bunch of these commands that are available for us because

33
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:08,500
we're authenticated.

34
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:14,590
So now let's actually run through maybe, I don't know, showing some jobs, for example.

35
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:16,080
Well, go ahead.

36
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,200
And I'm going to run this command.

37
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:22,150
And what this is doing is it's pretty much the same exact command that we had before, except now I'm

38
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:25,750
specifying the web socket argument with list jobs.

39
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:30,420
And as we can see, we have one job here called Test one.

40
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:31,890
Let's actually create a new job.

41
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:34,980
And what that means is where it's going to create a new pipeline.

42
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:38,460
And we're just going to create a template, one just to getting started one.

43
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:40,620
So I'm going to call this test two.

44
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:44,640
I'm going to click on Pipeline, then I'm going to click okay here.

45
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:50,040
I scroll all the way down and then you're going to see this try sample pipeline.

46
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:51,840
We'll click on Hello World.

47
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,510
This is just going to literally Echo Hello World here.

48
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,190
So I'm going to click Save.

49
00:02:56,850 --> 00:02:57,060
Then.

50
00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:01,020
Now what I'm going to do is I'm going to go back to my terminal to clear my screen and I'm going to

51
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:03,630
run the command to list jobs one more time.

52
00:03:04,850 --> 00:03:07,430
Now notice here I now have two jobs listed.

53
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:10,160
Before we only had test one.

54
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:12,980
Now we have test one and test two.

55
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:16,400
So I'm going to run a new command again.

56
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,740
This is always the same here, folks.

57
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:26,120
So the Java jar specifying the Jenkins jar, specifying the server URL specifying the auth.

58
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,200
This is always the same.

59
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:31,310
Really, the only thing that actually changes is the command itself.

60
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:34,060
So as you can see, we had the list Jobs command.

61
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:36,590
Now we're going to do the build command.

62
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:40,720
So we're going to do this build against test two.

63
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:46,160
So really quick, as you can see, we have no builds here currently literally nothing.

64
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:48,690
You go, and I'm going to run this command.

65
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:56,290
You go back to the Jenkins portal here, and as you can see, we now have a build that ran successfully.

66
00:03:56,530 --> 00:04:01,680
So if you want to get started with the Jenkins CLI, this is typically the best way.

67
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:08,740
Go through, learn about the authentication methods, learn how to list jobs, how to build jobs, etc..

68
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:10,540
Well, that's all for now.

69
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:12,250
Let's get some hands on practice.
