1
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:05,190
All right, everybody.

2
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:07,980
So now let's go ahead and look over the application.

3
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:12,630
So the application that we're going to be deploying is this go Web app sample app.

4
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:18,720
So I went ahead and I forked it to my GitHub organization under admin turned DevOps and you can find

5
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:21,480
it under the Go Web app sample repo.

6
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:24,030
So this is a very, very straightforward go app.

7
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:27,480
It uses go for the database backend.

8
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:33,270
And essentially what we could do is we come up, we log in and we get to this page, we go ahead and

9
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:39,450
we sign out here, we can type in test, test, and then we log in and then there are a few different

10
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:41,670
things that we can do inside of the application.

11
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:48,180
So if I scroll, you see, for example, we have access to a Swagger API.

12
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:54,300
So if I open that up, we can see all of the different API endpoints that are available.

13
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:58,950
So for example, we have one called auth log in account.

14
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:01,380
So let's go ahead and maybe check that out.

15
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:09,570
And to do that we'll just have to type in API auth log in status.

16
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:11,610
We can see that the login is true.

17
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:17,670
We go ahead and we look up account for example log in account.

18
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:20,100
We can see that this is the account that we're logged in as.

19
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:23,370
So this is the application that we're going to be using to deploy with Jenkins.

20
00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:28,290
If you want, please feel free to check this out on my GitHub repo, download it, play around with

21
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:33,660
it locally if you'd like, but we will see the full deployment process here throughout this course using

22
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:35,190
this application.

23
00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:38,450
Well, that's it for this lecture.

24
00:01:38,450 --> 00:01:39,890
We'll see you in the next.
