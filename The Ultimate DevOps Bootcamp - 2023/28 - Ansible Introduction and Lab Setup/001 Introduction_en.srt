00:00:01,359 --> 00:00:05,050
Hello and welcome to the Ansible for the absolute beginners course.

2
00:00:05,050 --> 00:00:09,010
My name is Chad Manabat and I will be your instructor for this course.

3
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:12,620
I'm a DevOps trainer at Code Cloud Dotcom.

4
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:19,700
The true hands on learn by doing platform have been working in the industry as a consultant for over

5
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:26,000
13 years and have helped hundreds of thousands of students learn technology in a fun and interactive

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:26,270
way.

7
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:33,590
In this course you will learn Ansible through a series of lectures that use animation and fun illustrations

8
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:35,880
that simplify complex concepts.

9
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:42,170
We have demos that will show you how to install and get started with Ansible, and most importantly,

10
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:46,760
we have hands on exercises that you can access right in your browser.

11
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:52,790
At the end of the course you will work on a real world project of deploying the Code Cloud e Commerce

12
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:55,640
application using simple playbooks.

13
00:00:56,570 --> 00:00:59,210
Let's now look at the objectives of this course.

14
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:05,420
Since this is for the absolute beginners, we go all the way from scratch, covering everything you

15
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:07,070
need to know to get started.

16
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:10,820
You don't need any prior coding or scripting experience.

17
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:15,170
We will get started with understanding what Ansible is and what it can do.

18
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:21,020
We will go through how to set up Ansible in your environment using a simple virtual machine deployed

19
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:22,340
using VirtualBox.

20
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:28,250
Then we will get started with an introduction to YAML, which is the language of Ansible.

21
00:01:28,370 --> 00:01:30,860
All ansible playbooks are written in YAML.

22
00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:36,920
One of the common challenges that beginners face in Ansible is understanding how to work with YAML.

23
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:39,140
But don't worry, we've got your back.

24
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:44,720
We have a number of coding exercises that will get you all set with YAML in no time.

25
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:52,000
We will then head over to Ansible inventory files, playbooks and various concepts such as variables,

26
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,520
conditionals, loops and roles.

27
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:01,540
Again, all of these concepts are accompanied by hands on exercises that give you enough practice to

28
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:04,090
be confident in automating with Ansible.

29
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:10,419
As with all of our other courses, we have hands on exercises that you can access right in your browser.

30
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:16,600
The browser gives you a quiz portal with a set of questions and an editor to answer the question.

31
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:20,230
Develop YAML files and playbooks to solve the quiz.

32
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:27,310
If you run into issues, you may view the hands or the solution section for the answer or reach us through

33
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:28,630
our Q&A section.

34
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:30,220
So let's get started.

35
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,290
I'm ready when you are.
