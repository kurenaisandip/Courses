00:00:01,730 --> 00:00:03,590
Hello and welcome to this demo.

2
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:09,920
In this demo we are going to see how to set up a lab environment to play around with Ansible.

3
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:17,180
In this demo, we will be setting up an entire lab environment on our laptop from scratch.

4
00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:23,810
For this, we will use a virtualization tool called Oracle VirtualBox.

5
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:31,880
Since it works with all flavors of operating systems like Windows, Linux and OS X.

6
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:32,630
So.

7
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:34,730
So this is what we plan to do.

8
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:42,830
We will first install Oracle VirtualBox on our laptop and then we'll create a template system based

9
00:00:42,830 --> 00:00:45,470
on the CentOS operating system.

10
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:51,650
Once we create the template, we will then be able to easily create multiple virtual machines as required

11
00:00:51,650 --> 00:00:52,970
from that template.

12
00:00:53,330 --> 00:01:00,710
For the purpose of this lab, we will first create a Ansible control machine from the template and then

13
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:07,970
we will move on to create two other machines which will act as the target machine for Ansible to perform

14
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:09,530
configuration changes on.

15
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:16,120
So in my case, I have a Windows system, so I will be setting up a lab environment on my Windows system.

16
00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:18,650
It doesn't really matter what operating system you're on.

17
00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:25,400
You could follow the same instructions to set up a lab environment on Linux or your Mac operating systems.

18
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:27,560
So in our case we're going to install virtual box.

19
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:34,490
So go to VirtualBox dot org and in the website you will have find a link to download the VirtualBox

20
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:35,240
software.

21
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:41,690
In the download page you will find links to download VirtualBox for specific operating systems.

22
00:01:42,410 --> 00:01:44,180
In my case, I'm mine is Windows.

23
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:50,870
I'm going to click on Windows and I'm going to download the software once downloaded, run the executable

24
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:55,730
and follow the instructions in the installation Wizard to complete installation.

25
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:59,870
In my case, I've already installed it, so I'm just going to cancel that.

26
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:07,580
After you install open up the Oracle VirtualBox interface and it will look something like this.

27
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:10,520
Now the next step is to deploy virtual machines.

28
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:17,110
In order to do that, you can either create a machine, attach a CD, drive of an operating system,

29
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:22,510
and follow the instructions to install the operating system as we are familiar with.

30
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:26,080
However, there's also another easy way.

31
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:32,560
There are pre installed pre configured operating system images available on the internet.

32
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:37,420
We could use those to easily deploy as many virtual machines as we need.

33
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:41,860
For this, if you go to the website OS boxes dot org.

34
00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:47,410
You will find a lot of pre-installed pre configured images of various operating systems.

35
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:50,230
Go to this site and select the VM images.

36
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:55,960
VirtualBox images link at the top and then you will be you will find a list of various different operating

37
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:56,440
systems.

38
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:58,510
From this we will select CentOS.

39
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:02,750
And then it will take us to the center of this page.

40
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:06,260
Here you can see information on downloading the center image.

41
00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:12,470
In our case, we're downloading the VirtualBox image for CentOS seven and we're downloading the 64 bit

42
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:13,130
version.

43
00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:15,920
So remember to download that particular version.

44
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:18,230
We will.

45
00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:23,650
Then it is downloaded as a seven zip file, which is a compressed file.

46
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:29,400
So you need a software to uncompressed it like guitar or winzip.

47
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:34,730
In my case, I'm using the seven zip software to extract the contents of the file into a folder.

48
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:39,810
Wait for it to finish the extraction process.

49
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:44,880
Once finished if you go into the folder.

50
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:48,170
You will see that there is a folder called 64 bit.

51
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:57,840
And inside that folder you'll find a file with the extension VDI that stands for virtual disk.

52
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,690
And that is what we will use to create our virtual machine.

53
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,300
We're now ready to create a new virtual machine.

54
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:11,430
So we go back into the Oracle VM VirtualBox interface, click on New and we fill in the name and operating

55
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:12,090
system.

56
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:18,750
Now I will name the virtual machine that I'm creating as CentOS template because as we discussed, we're

57
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:26,670
our goal is to create a template and then use that template to create as many virtual machines as I

58
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:27,150
need.

59
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,940
So I'm going to name it as CentOS template.

60
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:34,440
I will now select the type as Linux and the version.

61
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:39,870
Since it does not have CentOS listed, I could simply select other.

62
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:46,360
Now, as you can see under the versions, there are 32 bit as well as 64 bit options.

63
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:53,560
In our case, we downloaded the CentOS 64 bit version, so we must select a 64 bit option.

64
00:04:54,190 --> 00:05:01,210
Now, in case you do not see the 64 bit options in this list, and that is most probably because you

65
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:07,570
do not have the virtualization technology enabled on your laptop to enable virtualization technology

66
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:08,650
on your laptop.

67
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:12,160
It is usually under the BIOS settings.

68
00:05:12,670 --> 00:05:19,000
So if you simply Google enable virtualization in bios followed by your laptop model, you will see a

69
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:19,990
set of results.

70
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:25,520
It's usually usually looks something like this under the BIOS, under the advanced BIOS features.

71
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:32,530
You'll have something called as virtualization technology and you must ensure that it is set to enable

72
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:33,100
state.

73
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:40,360
So once you do that, restart your laptop and you will find the 64 bit option, select the other Linux

74
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:43,480
64 bit option for this and click next.

75
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:48,010
In the next here we select a memory size by default.

76
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:55,300
It's set to 512 NB and let's change that to around two GB So we'll set it to two two gigs.

77
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:59,740
In the next step, we select the hard disk that we downloaded.

78
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:02,140
So in this case.

79
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:07,680
The default selection is create a virtual hard disk now, but that is not what we want.

80
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:15,180
We already have a pre-built image of a hard disk downloaded, so we're going to specify that select

81
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:22,380
the user, an existing virtual hard disk file option, and click on Browse and Browse to the file that

82
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:27,180
we downloaded and extracted, which is the center is seven file with the VDI extension.

83
00:06:27,450 --> 00:06:27,900
Click on.

84
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:28,260
Okay.

85
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:29,910
And that creates the file.

86
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:34,980
Now, before powering on the template, we will go into settings and make a few more changes.

87
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:43,200
Go to system and we'll increase the CPU to around two and we go to network section and we will set the

88
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,340
adapter one to bridge network.

89
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:52,050
This way my virtual machine gets an IP address as well as it can connect to the internet to download

90
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:54,120
and install packages as required.

91
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:57,240
I will now go ahead and power on the system.

92
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:08,730
Okay.

93
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:15,830
And now at the login prompt, select the default user, which is the which is O's boxes.

94
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:21,290
Now the password to find out the password for any images downloaded from OS boxes dot org.

95
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:26,570
Go to the info section and then you'll see that the username is OS boxes and the password is always

96
00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:28,160
boxes dot org.

97
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:31,760
So I'm going to use that password os boxes dot org.

98
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:38,040
I will click on sign in to log in to the centre.

99
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:38,870
A system.

100
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:42,260
I will open up a terminal.

101
00:07:44,290 --> 00:07:46,570
And typing if config.

102
00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:48,680
The AF config.

103
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:50,300
Command.

104
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:54,830
Tells me the IP address currently assigned to the virtual machine.

105
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:59,630
As you can see, it is 190 2.168.1.112.

106
00:08:00,590 --> 00:08:08,180
Now I will open up a SSH terminal to SSH into that virtual machine.

107
00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:14,720
Now in my case I'm using a terminal software called as mobile XTERM.

108
00:08:14,810 --> 00:08:15,770
I like to use this.

109
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:18,110
This is a free software that is available.

110
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:21,170
You could use any SSH terminal software.

111
00:08:21,170 --> 00:08:23,150
You could simply use putty as well.

112
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:33,230
So create a new SSH session and specify the IP address, which is 190 2.168.1.112.

113
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:39,090
And the username is Oz Boxes.

114
00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:40,659
Click on.

115
00:08:40,659 --> 00:08:41,260
Okay.

116
00:08:43,730 --> 00:08:49,160
Now we'll specify the password which is OS boxes dot org and I'm logged in.

117
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:56,260
Once I verify that I'm able to ssh into it, I will now shut it down so that I can create.

118
00:08:57,410 --> 00:08:59,390
Clones of this virtual machine.
