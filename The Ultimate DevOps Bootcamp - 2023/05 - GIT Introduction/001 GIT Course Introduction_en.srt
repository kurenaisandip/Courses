Hey, everyone.

2
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:24,040
I'm Lydia, Hailey, and I'll be your instructor for this Gift for Beginners course on Code Cloud.

3
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:29,870
Throughout my career as a software developer, I've also mentored a lot of new and advanced developers

4
00:00:29,870 --> 00:00:32,509
in order to help them improve and optimize their work.

5
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:38,630
And by writing technical blog posts in a more visual way, I try to make those overwhelming computer

6
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:41,030
science concepts seem less overwhelming.

7
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:43,700
And one of those topics is get through this course.

8
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:49,250
I want to show you that git is actually an amazing tool to work with and I want to make you a fearless

9
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:50,180
git developer.

10
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:55,100
In this course, you'll learn how to get up and running with gates, how to use it in your daily life,

11
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:57,320
and how it actually works under the hood.

12
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:02,750
We'll cover the possibilities of having a local and remote git repository and adding version control

13
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:04,550
to your project by using branches.

14
00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:09,260
And of course we'll cover all the useful commands that you can use with these branches to make working

15
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:12,080
with get even more powerful besides some common gate commands.

16
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:16,820
We'll also cover how Git actually works under the hood in order to get a better understanding of what

17
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:17,990
we're actually doing.

18
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:23,810
After each section, you'll get to test your new information with the hands on labs in order to fully

19
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:29,510
grasp the new concepts you'll work as if you're working on a real project with real team members.

20
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:34,940
So you have to push code, pull code, resolve, merge conflicts, and will validate it in order to

21
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:37,490
make sure that you actually understood it correctly.

22
00:01:37,490 --> 00:01:41,780
I am really excited to be teaching this interactive course on Git and I hope you are too.

23
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:42,980
So let's dive right in.
