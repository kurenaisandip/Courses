00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:05,040
You can see the commits that were made to the project in your terminal.

2
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:12,180
The command get log shows the information that you need to know about all the commits, such as the

3
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:19,170
commit hash, the author name, the date of the commit and the commit message.

4
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:24,420
We'll talk more about the commit hash and what it means later on in this course.

5
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:31,080
If you don't care about all this extra information about the commit, you can easily show it as one

6
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:34,140
line with a dash, dash one line option.

7
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:39,390
There are actually many ways to visualize our commits with the git log command.

8
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:45,570
Throughout the course I'll show some different configuration options for the different use cases.
