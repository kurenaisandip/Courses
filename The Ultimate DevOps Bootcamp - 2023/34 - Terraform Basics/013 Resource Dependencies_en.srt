00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:07,020
In this lecture, we will take a look at the different types of resource dependencies in TerraForm.

2
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:14,430
In the previous lecture, we saw how to link one resource to another using reference attributes by making

3
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:17,040
use of reference, expression and interpolation.

4
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:23,220
We were able to make use of the output of the random bit resource as an input for the local file resource.

5
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:29,730
Now, when TerraForm creates these resources, it knows about the dependency since the local file resource

6
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:32,549
depends on the output of the random pet resource.

7
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:36,590
As a result, it uses the following order to provision them.

8
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:42,860
First, TerraForm creates the random pet resource and then it creates the local file resource.

9
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:49,550
When resources are deleted, TerraForm deletes it in the reverse order the local file first and then

10
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:50,510
the random pet.

11
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:54,290
This type of dependency is called the implicit dependency.

12
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:59,600
Here we are not explicitly specifying which resource is dependent on which other resource.

13
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:02,090
TerraForm figures it out by itself.

14
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:07,340
However, there is another way to specify dependency within the configuration file.

15
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:13,940
For example, let us make use of the older configuration file without making use of the reference expression

16
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:15,230
for the file content.

17
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:20,760
If you still want to make sure that the local file resource is created after the random pet.

18
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:24,840
We can do this by using the depends on argument like this.

19
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:31,760
Here we have added a depends on argument inside the resource block for the local file, and we have

20
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:36,320
provided a list of dependencies that include the random pet resource called the My Pet.

21
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:41,720
This will ensure that the local file is only created after the random resources created.

22
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:46,210
This type of dependency is called an explicit dependency.

23
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:54,030
Explicitly specifying dependency is only necessary when a resource relies on some other resource indirectly,

24
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:57,610
and it does not make use of a reference expression as seen in this case.

25
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:03,930
In the later sections of this course, we will see how and when to use this in a real world use case.

26
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:10,240
Now let's head over to the hands on labs and explore working with resource dependencies in TerraForm.
