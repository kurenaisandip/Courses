00:00:01,870 --> 00:00:02,980
In this lecture.

2
00:00:02,980 --> 00:00:06,370
Let's take a look at providers in more detail.

3
00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:14,630
We saw in the previous lecture that after we write a TerraForm configuration file, the first thing

4
00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:18,800
to do is to initialize the directory with the TerraForm Init command.

5
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:25,880
When we run TerraForm in it within a directory containing the configuration files, TerraForm downloads

6
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:30,110
and installs plugins for the providers used within the configuration.

7
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:38,280
These can be plug ins for cloud providers such as AWS, GCP, Azure, or something as simple as the

8
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:42,120
local provider that we use to create a local file type resource.

9
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:48,630
TerraForm uses a plugin based architecture to work with hundreds of such infrastructure platforms.

10
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:55,230
Different providers are distributed by Hashicorp and are publicly available in the TerraForm Registry

11
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:58,680
at the URL Registry dot TerraForm dot o.

12
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:02,030
There are three tiers of providers.

13
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:05,260
The first one is the official provider.

14
00:01:05,710 --> 00:01:12,520
These are owned and maintained by Hashicorp and include the major cloud providers such as GCP and Azure.

15
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:17,800
The local provider that we have used so far is also an official provider.

16
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:21,850
The second type of provider is a verified provider.

17
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:28,390
A verified provider is owned and maintained by a third party technology company that has gone through

18
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:30,790
a partner provider process with Hashicorp.

19
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:38,530
Some of the examples are the big IP provider from Fine Networks, Heroku, Digital, Ocean, etc..

20
00:01:39,650 --> 00:01:45,080
And finally, we have the community providers that are published and maintained by individual contributors

21
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:46,640
of the Hashicorp community.

22
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:53,580
The TerraForm init command went run shows the version of the plugin that is being installed.

23
00:01:54,690 --> 00:02:02,910
In this case we can see that the plugin name Hashicorp slash local with the version 2.00 has been installed

24
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:03,930
in the directory.

25
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:10,729
Deter from init is a safe command and it can be run as many times as needed without impacting the actual

26
00:02:10,729 --> 00:02:12,560
infrastructure that is deployed.

27
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:20,970
The plug ins are downloaded into a hidden directory called TerraForm slash plugins in the working directory

28
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:22,770
containing the configuration files.

29
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:29,220
In our example, the working directory is slash root slash terraform dash local file.

30
00:02:31,070 --> 00:02:32,930
The plugin name that you see here.

31
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:37,730
Hashicorp Slash Local is also known as the source address.

32
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:44,210
This is an identifier that is used by TerraForm to locate and download the plugin from the registry.

33
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:47,390
Let's take a closer look at the format of the name.

34
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:54,650
The first part of the name, which in this case is Hashicorp is the organizational namespace.

35
00:02:55,100 --> 00:03:00,140
This is followed by the type which is the name of the provider, such as local.

36
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:07,760
Other examples of providers are AWS, Azure, ARM, Google, Random, etc..

37
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:11,840
The plugin name can also optionally have a hostname in front.

38
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:16,100
The hostname is the name of the registry where the plugin is located.

39
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:22,700
If omitted, it defaults to registry dot terraform dot IO, which is Hashicorp public registry.

40
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:30,390
Given the fact that the local provider is stored in the public from registry within the Hashicorp namespace,

41
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:37,860
the source address for it can be represented as registry dot, terraform, dot IO slash Hashicorp slash

42
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:42,930
local or simply by hashicorp slash local by omitting the hostname.

43
00:03:44,210 --> 00:03:48,350
By default, TerraForm installs the latest version of the provider.

44
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:54,600
Provide The plugins, especially the official ones, are constantly updated with newer versions.

45
00:03:54,630 --> 00:04:01,530
This is done to bring in new functionality or to add in bug fixes and these can introduce breaking changes

46
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:02,400
to your code.

47
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:08,440
We can lock down our configuration files to make use of a specific provider version as well.

48
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:11,500
We will see how to do that later in this course.
