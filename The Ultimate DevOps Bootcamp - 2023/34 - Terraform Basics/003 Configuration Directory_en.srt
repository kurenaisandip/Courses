00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:08,130
Now let's take a look at the configuration directory and the file naming conventions used in TerraForm.

2
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:16,219
So far, we have been working with a single configuration file called local ATF, and this is within

3
00:00:16,219 --> 00:00:21,230
the directory called TerraForm Dash local file, which is our configuration directory.

4
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:25,490
This directory is not limited to one configuration file.

5
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:29,380
We can create another configuration file like this.

6
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:36,870
The ADF is another configuration file that makes use of the same local underscore file resource.

7
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:41,720
When applied, it will create a new file called cad dot txt.

8
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:48,160
TerraForm will consider any file with the TTF extension within the configuration directory.

9
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:54,660
Another common practice is to have one single configuration file that contains all the resource blocks

10
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:56,700
required to provision the infrastructure.

11
00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:02,520
A single configuration file can have as many number of configuration blocks that you need.

12
00:01:03,610 --> 00:01:09,850
A common naming convention used for such a configuration file is to call it the main F.

13
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:15,950
There are other configuration files that can be created within the directory, such as the variables

14
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:17,330
ATF output.

15
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:18,800
ATF and providers.

16
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:19,610
ATF.

17
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:24,410
We will talk more about these files in the later sections of this course.

18
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:31,100
Now let's head over to the Hands-On Labs and explore working with providers.
