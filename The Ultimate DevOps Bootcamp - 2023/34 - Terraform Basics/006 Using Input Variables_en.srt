00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:07,340
In this lecture, we will see how to make use of variables in TerraForm.

2
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:11,940
We have used several arguments in our form block so far.

3
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:19,020
For the local file, we have a file, name and content, and for the random pet resource, we have used

4
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:22,860
the prefix separator and length as the arguments.

5
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:29,040
Since these values are directly defined within the main configuration files, they are considered to

6
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:30,780
be hardcoded values.

7
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:34,230
Hard coding values is not a good idea.

8
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:41,460
For one, this limits the reusability of the code, which defeats the purpose of using IAC.

9
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:48,520
We want to make sure that the same code can be used again and again to deploy resources based on a set

10
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:52,630
of input variables that can be provided during the execution.

11
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:56,720
And that is where input variables come into the picture.

12
00:00:57,530 --> 00:01:04,550
Just as in any general purpose programming language such as Bash, scripting or PowerShell, we can

13
00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:09,120
make use of input variables in TerraForm to assign variables.

14
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:16,040
Let us create a new configuration file called Variables DF and define the values like this.

15
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:25,900
The variables file, just like the main file consists of blocks and arguments to create a variable,

16
00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:28,490
use the keyword called variable.

17
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:31,490
This is followed by the variable name.

18
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:38,820
This can be named anything but as a standard, use an appropriate name such as the argument name for

19
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:40,440
which we are using the variable.

20
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:44,880
Within this block we can provide a default value for the variable.

21
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:51,660
This is an optional parameter, but it is a quick and simple way to assign values to the variables.

22
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:55,890
We will see the other methods to do so in a later lecture.

23
00:01:56,590 --> 00:01:57,340
Great.

24
00:01:57,610 --> 00:02:04,210
Now we have our variable configuration file, but how do we use it within the main file?

25
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:12,830
To do this, we can replace the argument values with the variable names prefix with a war like this.

26
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:19,500
When using variables, you do not have to enclose the values inside double quotes as you would when

27
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,180
providing actual values.

28
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:26,790
And using the same execution flow that we have seen many times by now.

29
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:32,010
We can create the resources using TerraForm Plan, followed by the TerraForm apply.

30
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:35,760
The resources have now been created as expected.

31
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:43,720
Now, if you want to make an update to the resources by making changes to the existing arguments, we

32
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:47,050
can do that by just updating the variables file.

33
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,230
The main ATF need not be modified.

34
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:57,610
For example, let us update the local file resource to create the file at the same location, but with

35
00:02:57,610 --> 00:02:59,590
an updated content that reads.

36
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:02,620
My favorite pet is Mrs. Whiskers.

37
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:08,240
And for the random pet resource, let's change the length of the pet name to two.

38
00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:11,110
We can do that like this.

39
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:17,400
As expected, when we run TerraForm Apply, it will recreate the resources.

40
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:23,460
The content of the file has been changed and the pet name now has two words following the prefix.

41
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:31,150
Before we conclude this lecture, here is an example of what our configuration files would look like

42
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:32,450
when creating an easy to.

43
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:36,610
Instance in a case with TerraForm while making use of input variables.

44
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:42,700
Don't worry if the resource block and the arguments are unfamiliar, we have a separate lecture where

45
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:46,420
we will be making use of resources later in the course.
