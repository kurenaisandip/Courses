1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:07,530
In order to keep our local and remote repo in sync, we have to push the data from our local repo to

2
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:08,760
the remote repo.

3
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:13,740
We can push data to a remote repo with a git push command.

4
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,340
This command expects two more arguments.

5
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:23,940
The alias of a remote repo which we called origin in this case and the current branch that we're on.

6
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:30,300
We haven't made any GID branches yet, so we're just on a default branch named master.

7
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:36,690
It can happen that we've made some new commits locally that we haven't pushed to the remote repository

8
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:37,200
yet.

9
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:45,750
In this case, the remote repository is not in sync with the local repo by using the git push command.

10
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:50,160
We can push the newly committed files to the remote repository.

11
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:57,930
Now that we've pushed a new data, any developer that has access to our remote repository can fetch

12
00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:00,120
the latest changes that we just pushed.
