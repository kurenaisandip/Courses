1
00:00:01,450 --> 00:00:08,350
In the previous examples, we saw that we could merge branches directly into the master branch by first

2
00:00:08,350 --> 00:00:11,170
checking out to master and then merging them.

3
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:16,329
When you're working with a team, however, you usually don't want to do this.

4
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:20,830
Instead, we can do all of this on a platform like GitHub.

5
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:29,020
In order to push the latest change to GitHub will push to the Origin Sierra branch by typing git push

6
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:30,280
origin Sierra.

7
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:37,670
After pushing to the Sarah branch and checking out the GitHub repo, you'll see a pop up that shows

8
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:41,810
that the master branch is now one commit behind the Sarah branch.

9
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:50,000
In order to merge Sara into master will have to open something called a pull request.

10
00:00:50,330 --> 00:00:56,510
We can do that by clicking the pull request button in the top bar or the pull request button shown in

11
00:00:56,510 --> 00:00:57,500
this pop up.

12
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:04,319
Once we've clicked on that button, you'll see the changes that were made to the Sarah branch compared

13
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:08,310
to the master branch and a button to create a pool request.

14
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,500
Let's create a pull request also called a PR.

15
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:22,240
We can add additional information about the changes that we've made, such as a title and a description,

16
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:27,760
maybe some important labels, or add specific reviewers for this pull request.

17
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:34,550
Now that the pool request has been opened, other team members can see the changes that you've made

18
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:35,720
and comment on them.

19
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:42,620
If everything has been approved, you can merge your changes into master by clicking the merge pull

20
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:43,730
request button.

21
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:45,470
Perfect.

22
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:50,930
Instead of checking out to master locally emerging it that way, we've just merged our changes into

23
00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:54,770
master by creating a pull request emerging it on GitHub.

24
00:01:55,100 --> 00:02:02,990
The origin Sara branch has now been merged into the Origin Master branch to make sure that not anyone

25
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:05,700
can just merge changes into the master branch.

26
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:08,750
You need to have the right privileges to do so.

27
00:02:09,169 --> 00:02:15,680
This is the default if it's your own repo, but if you're working in a larger team, you may need to

28
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,980
ask other team members to merge the PR for you.
