00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:06,030
So far, our examples used a small team of individuals working together.

2
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:07,920
Since it's a small team.

3
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:13,890
All members of the remote Git repository had the right permissions to push their changes right in.

4
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,870
However, this isn't always the case.

5
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:22,800
There are thousands of open source projects on GitHub with millions of contributors contributing to

6
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:23,310
them.

7
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:28,420
All of these contributors are not members of these projects with write permissions.

8
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:32,369
We don't want just anyone to be able to modify our code, of course.

9
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:39,030
So how do you create a pool request if you're not part of the get project and therefore not allowed

10
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:42,210
to create branches or push your changes right in?

11
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:48,310
One way to contribute to such projects is to first fork the main project.

12
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:55,060
After forking the project, you can add your changes to a branch on the fourth copy and send a pull

13
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:58,870
request to the original project to merge your changes right in.

14
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:06,170
When you forge a git repository, you're creating your own copy of the original project.

15
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:12,110
You're free to experiment with it and do whatever you want to do with the repository without impacting

16
00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:13,610
the original project.

17
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:19,490
Once you think that you have something to contribute to the original project, you can create a pool

18
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:20,600
request safely.

19
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:27,920
The reviewers of the original project can now review the changes submitted by you and give feedback

20
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,300
to you if required.

21
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:36,320
Once your PR has been approved by the maintainers, they can merge your changes into the original repository.

22
00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:40,550
You've now successfully contributed to an open source project.
