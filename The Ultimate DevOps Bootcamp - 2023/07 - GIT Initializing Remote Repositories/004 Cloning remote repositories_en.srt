00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:06,930
When a new team member gets added to the project and should get access to all the data that's currently

2
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:14,040
hosted on the remote repository, that person can clone the repository in order to get all this data

3
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:15,720
on their local machines.

4
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:24,600
You can clone a repository with a git clone command followed by the SSH link of the remote repository.

5
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:27,960
So let's see how we can get that SSH link.

6
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:36,720
Each forum has a different UI and a different way to access the SSH link in order to clone the repository.

7
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:41,850
But in this case, let's just focus on the most popular platform GitHub.

8
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:49,590
When visiting the remote repository, you see a big green button with a text clone.

9
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:56,580
Once you click on that button, you see a flyout with the s h link that we need in order to clone the

10
00:00:56,580 --> 00:00:57,600
repository.

11
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:05,740
We can now clone it locally on our machine with a git clone command followed by the ssh link that we

12
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:06,670
just copied.

13
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:13,830
By default, it will create a folder locally with the same name as the remote repository, which you

14
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:14,970
can see here.

15
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:21,370
Let's go into the folder that was just cloned with the CD command.

16
00:01:22,510 --> 00:01:29,020
When we type get log, you can see that we have the entire Jets history of the project that we just

17
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:29,830
cloned.

18
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:36,400
We can now get started to work on this project locally and interact with the remote repository when

19
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:40,810
we've made changes in order for the entire team to stay up to date.
