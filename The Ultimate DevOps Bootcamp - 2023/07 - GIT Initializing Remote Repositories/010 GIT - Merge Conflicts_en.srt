1
00:00:01,230 --> 00:00:08,280
In most cases get is smart enough to know how files should be modified when we're merging branches.

2
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:11,070
However, that's not always the case.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,660
Imagine that Sarah started working on a fourth story.

4
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:19,910
But she didn't communicate this with Max.

5
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:23,510
So Max also started working on the fourth story.

6
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:30,550
Sarah was a bit quicker though, and Mercer changes back into Master.

7
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:35,680
Max now wants to go ahead and merge his change into Master as well.

8
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:42,850
But the master branch contains changes compared to the Max branch in a file that we're currently trying

9
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:43,750
to merge.

10
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:51,820
However, the file within Master says this is Sarah's version, whereas Max's version says this is Max's

11
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:52,570
version.

12
00:00:53,110 --> 00:01:00,310
Get doesn't know which which version you want to keep and we just ended up in a merge conflict.

13
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:05,140
There are several ways to resolve those conflicts.

14
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:13,870
For example in get these or simply in the code editor during a conflict get add some extra characters

15
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:14,470
to the file.

16
00:01:14,470 --> 00:01:15,640
That's conflicting.

17
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:22,000
Git shows the current context of the conflicting files as well as the contents that we're trying to

18
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:22,720
merge.

19
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:30,190
We can simply remove the lines that we don't want to keep and leave the lines that we do want to keep

20
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:31,810
and then save the file again.

21
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:39,730
During the conflict, we made some changes to the four storied TXT file which will have to add to get

22
00:01:39,730 --> 00:01:40,330
again.

23
00:01:41,230 --> 00:01:46,360
After adding it, we can finally merge the match branch without any conflicts.

24
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:51,700
Master now contains a combination of Max's and Sarah's changes.
