00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:06,870
We just updated the Origin Master branch by merging Origin Sara into it.

2
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:13,890
Our local repository isn't automatically aware of these changes, so we'd have to get these changes

3
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:15,960
into a local repository.

4
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:19,230
We can do so with the git fetch command.

5
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:25,680
We can type git fetch master in order to update the origin master branch in our local repo.

6
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:32,970
Now that we fetched the origin master, we can update our local master branch to point to the latest

7
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:35,160
changes made on Origin Master.

8
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:40,170
To do that we can merge Origin Master into the local master branch.

9
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:43,140
Awesome.

10
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:46,590
We now have all the latest changes available locally.

11
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:54,630
Instead of individually fetching and then merging, we can also pool the Origin master branch with the

12
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:56,040
git pool command.

13
00:00:56,430 --> 00:01:05,580
Git pool is actually two commands in one git fetch and get merge by typing git pool origin master.

14
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:11,460
We can fetch and merge the remote changes directly into our local master branch.

15
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:13,410
That's it.

16
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:14,060
For now.

17
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:16,830
It's time to gain some hands on practice.
