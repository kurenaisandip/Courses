00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:13,730
Hello and welcome to this course on TerraForm for Beginners.

2
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,470
My name is Vision Palese and I will be your instructor for this course.

3
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:22,740
In this course, we will get started with TerraForm.

4
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:29,370
But first we will take a look at infrastructure as code or IAC and the different types of tools available

5
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:33,990
in IAC and their purpose in managing the modern IT infrastructure.

6
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:38,830
We will then see the role of TerraForm in today's IT infrastructure.

7
00:00:39,650 --> 00:00:42,320
Then we will learn how to install TerraForm.

8
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:46,340
This is followed by the basics of Hashicorp configuration language.

9
00:00:47,410 --> 00:00:52,900
Next, we have our very first lab where you'll get your hands dirty working with the seal syntax.

10
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:58,830
Next, we will understand the basic software form, such as providers, input and output variables,

11
00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:01,050
resource attributes and dependencies.

12
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:08,730
After this, we will take a look at state inter reform, what it is, why it is used, and the considerations

13
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:10,590
to follow when working with state.

14
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:16,740
We then dig deeper into the fundamentals, starting with different commands provided by TerraForm.

15
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:22,850
This is followed by a lecture where we understand the difference between mutable and immutable infrastructure.

16
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:29,000
Next, we'll take a look at lifecycle rules in TerraForm, where we'll learn how to manage the ways

17
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,800
in which resources are created.

18
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:32,430
After this.

19
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:38,430
We have lectures on basic topics such as data sources, meta arguments such as count and for each and

20
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:41,010
finally understand version constraints in TerraForm.

21
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:42,850
After this.

22
00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:45,700
We have a dedicated section on AWS.

23
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:51,370
This section begins with optional lectures and demos where we learn the basics of AWS.

24
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:59,610
Such as setting up an account and learning about the basic services such as IAM SW three and Dynamo

25
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:00,150
DB.

26
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:04,950
We will then see how to provision and manage these using TerraForm.

27
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:11,660
Each of these topics, including the ones for us, are followed by hands on labs where we get to practice

28
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:13,250
the concepts that we have learned.

29
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:19,580
We will then learn concepts such as remote, state and state, locking with TerraForm and then see how

30
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:22,100
to store state in a remote SW three backend.

31
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:27,320
Next, we will see how to use their form state commands to manipulate the state file.

32
00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:33,640
We then have a few lectures and demos where we get introduced to the easy to service and then learn

33
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:35,800
how to provision it using TerraForm.

34
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:42,050
Following this, we will learn about provisions in reform, what they are, the different types, the

35
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:45,530
behavior and considerations to follow when working with provisionals.

36
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:52,370
We then look at resource states, learn how to enable debugging, and then import other resources into

37
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:53,960
the management of TerraForm.

38
00:02:55,220 --> 00:03:00,440
Next, we will learn about TerraForm modules, what they are, how to create them, and how to make

39
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:04,010
use of the modules which are available in the Public TerraForm Registry.

40
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:09,620
After this, we have a few lectures where we learn about functions and conditional expressions in TerraForm

41
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:12,350
and how to test them using the TerraForm console.

42
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:18,910
We will then learn about workspaces inter form what they are, how to create them and when to use them.

43
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:24,650
We will then wrap up this course with an introduction and high level overview of the features that are

44
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:26,450
provided by TerraForm Cloud.

45
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:32,470
In this course, we have video lectures that simplify complex concepts using animations.

46
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:38,950
In the section of this course, we have demonstration videos that are intended to help you get started

47
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:46,120
with us and make use of services such as IAM, Dynamo, DB and EC two with the AWS management console.

48
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:52,710
We have hands on labs where you will get to provision and manage infrastructure resources using TerraForm.

49
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:57,030
You don't need to set up your own labs or create any cloud accounts.

50
00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:01,590
Our labs are embedded in the course and open right in your browser.

51
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:04,160
To optimize the user experience.

52
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:07,010
We have integrated Visual Studio code with the labs.

53
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:12,560
This will allow you to make use of the built in TerraForm extensions to write configuration files easily

54
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,500
and then run the commands from the integrated terminal.

55
00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:21,320
You would also be developing configuration files that will work with the AWS infrastructure.

56
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:25,790
Well, I am very excited to begin this journey with you.

57
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,420
So let's get started.
