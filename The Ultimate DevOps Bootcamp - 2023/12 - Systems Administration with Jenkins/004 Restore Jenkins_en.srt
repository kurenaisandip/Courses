00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:10,190
Now that Jenkins is backed up, what if we want to actually restore Jenkins to this backup right here?

2
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:12,110
Well, let's go ahead and test that out.

3
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:14,540
So we're going to go to thin backup.

4
00:00:14,810 --> 00:00:17,000
We're going to click on Restore.

5
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:23,780
And now, as you can see, I actually have an option right here, restore from this backup.

6
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:27,350
What I want to do really quick is I want to take another backup.

7
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:31,410
And then I'm going to go to settings really quick.

8
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:37,050
I'm going to scroll down and we're literally going to back up everything.

9
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:38,070
Oop.

10
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:40,380
Right.

11
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:41,400
I'm going to save that.

12
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:43,620
Then I'm going to click back up again.

13
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:46,680
Okay.

14
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:53,430
And then just to confirm, as we can see, we have our three backups now.

15
00:00:53,910 --> 00:01:00,270
So if I click on Restore, I now have three different backups and it'll tell me in the time so I can

16
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:03,390
just restore from the latest here.

17
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,240
Go ahead and I'll click Restore.

18
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:08,980
Right.

19
00:01:08,990 --> 00:01:13,670
And just like that, we are back up and running it really quick.

20
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:18,110
Obviously, there isn't a whole bunch of stuff going on on this server, so it didn't take too long.

21
00:01:18,110 --> 00:01:23,660
But that's essentially how you can back up and restore on your Jenkins server.

22
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:27,950
Well, that's it for this lecture we'll see in the next.
