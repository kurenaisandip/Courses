1
00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:10,040
As with any server, any application running on any server, that server needs to be administered.

2
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:16,520
So you need to think about backing up that server and backing up specific files and folders that are

3
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:18,890
necessary for Jenkins to run.

4
00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:21,460
You need to think about your restore strategy.

5
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:24,790
A backup is only as good as the RESTORE policy.

6
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:29,870
You could have a million backups in the world, but if you can't restore it properly, those backups

7
00:00:29,870 --> 00:00:35,540
really don't mean much because it's a system, because it's an actual application running on a system.

8
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:40,220
Yes, Jenkins is nothing more than an application running on a system.

9
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:43,430
You need to think about how to monitor Jenkins.

10
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:50,700
Now when you're monitoring Jenkins and let's say something is going wrong, you're diagnosing errors.

11
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:53,820
You're looking at errors that pop up in the monitoring.

12
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:56,940
You're going to have to understand how to diagnose and how to fix.

13
00:00:57,450 --> 00:01:01,140
Now, just like restores are only as good as a backup.

14
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:05,200
A system is only as good as how it can scale.

15
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:10,590
So, for example, let's say you're running two Jenkins servers and you need to scale up to three.

16
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:13,170
You need to scale up to four due to the load.

17
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:18,660
You need to understand how to do that because it's pretty easy in a large organization to need to scale

18
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:24,360
up those servers, depending on how many people are hitting those servers and how many jobs in the pipelines

19
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:25,080
they're running.

20
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:29,160
And then finally, you need to fully understand how to manage Jenkins.

21
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:35,100
Jenkins isn't one of those platforms that you can just put up and walk away and not touch it for ten

22
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:35,550
years.

23
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:39,210
You have to actually manage it because there is a system underneath.

24
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:41,070
There are updates that need to be done.

25
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:43,560
There are patches that need to be done.

26
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:48,390
So with that, let's go ahead and talk about administering Jenkins in this section.

27
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,650
Well, that's it for this lecture.

28
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:53,100
We'll see you in the next.
