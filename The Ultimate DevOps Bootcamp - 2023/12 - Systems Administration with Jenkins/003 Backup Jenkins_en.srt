1
00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:05,200
When it comes to backups and.

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:10,610
JENKINS There's not like a specific solution that you would use.

3
00:00:10,630 --> 00:00:14,650
Really, it's kind of up to three different ways.

4
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:20,530
Number one, you could either do file system snapshots, which snapshots aren't real backups.

5
00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:23,560
So I wouldn't recommend that as a long term solution.

6
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:29,980
But it's good for a daily kind of thing, maybe instead of an incremental route.

7
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:34,210
Next, you have plug ins for backups, which again, plug ins.

8
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:40,360
We have the ability to install and extend different services and different features in Jenkins.

9
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:44,710
Or you could write a shell script that backs up the Jenkins instance.

10
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:49,180
Now, for this section, what we're going to do is we're going to go and we're going to use one of the

11
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:50,170
plug ins.

12
00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:55,840
But if you'd like to check out a Shell script, I did find this Shell script online, which you can

13
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:01,090
get to via this GitHub organization and then this GitHub repository right here.

14
00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:03,820
And at that point, you can check it out.

15
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:05,260
See if this works for you.

16
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:11,470
But for me, I think it made more sense to kind of use a plug in because it's a little bit more managed

17
00:01:11,470 --> 00:01:13,570
than maybe a one off script.

18
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:18,100
So what I'm going to do is in the Jenkins portal, I'm going to go to manage Jenkins.

19
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:21,690
And then I'm going to go to manage plugins.

20
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:27,000
And I'm going to go to available and then I'm going to type in back up.

21
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:33,210
Now, there are a few here, but from what I saw and what I see in the field, a lot of people typically

22
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:34,860
do use thin backups.

23
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:36,840
So we'll go ahead and we'll go with that one.

24
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:41,010
But I don't see anything wrong with trying out some of these other ones, like the Google Cloud backup,

25
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:41,740
for example.

26
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:43,560
Sounds kind of interesting, actually.

27
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:48,990
So I'm going to go in and I'm going to click thin backup and then I'm going to say install without restart.

28
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:57,530
I'm going to scroll down here and we can see that it did just install successfully.

29
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:05,570
So if I scroll back up and I click on Manage Jenkins again, now I just go and I scroll down here,

30
00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:10,729
I can see then back up now back up your global and job specific configuration.

31
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:11,630
So I'm going go ahead.

32
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:12,830
I'm going to click on that.

33
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,170
And then I have a few options.

34
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:17,720
I can either backup, restore or click settings.

35
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,280
Let's kind of see what's in settings.

36
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:24,500
Backup directory, which if we click on that, specify the backup directory.

37
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:27,080
The Hudson process needs write access to directory.

38
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:32,750
Really, what this means is the backup directory of where this is being backed up.

39
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:38,930
So like on a local server on a file share somewhere, something like that, we can set up some backup

40
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:47,420
schedules, backup schedules for differential and full backups, number of backup sets, files excluded.

41
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:48,890
And then what files?

42
00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:50,120
We want to back up here.

43
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:54,950
I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to click back and then I'll click back up now.

44
00:02:57,170 --> 00:02:59,300
Now that, of course, will not work.

45
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:01,310
I just wanted to go ahead and showcase that.

46
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:05,780
The reason why is because we need a backup directory.

47
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:12,230
So what we're going to do is we're going to search into our server type in my password.

48
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:22,400
And then I'm just going to do just to see my home directory here and then I'm going to say MK Dear Jenkins

49
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,330
backup.

50
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:29,570
If I just see Jenkins back backup again, and this is my path.

51
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:31,970
So I'm going go ahead and I'm going to copy this.

52
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:37,580
And as we can see, the directory does exist, but it's not writable.

53
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:43,130
So depending on the permissions that you have on a server in an organization, the policies that are

54
00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:47,690
available, you're going to need to set up these permissions for the directory here.

55
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:52,520
So what I did was I just C.H. modify it to seven, seven, seven.

56
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:55,560
That pretty much just means open it up to everything.

57
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:57,120
It's obviously not ideal.

58
00:03:57,140 --> 00:04:02,840
Again, depending on your organization is totally going to depend on the policy, but for testing purposes

59
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:06,230
and just to showcase how the backup works, this is fine.

60
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:09,710
So I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to save that.

61
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:13,430
Now I can click a back up now.

62
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:21,709
So now what we can do is I'm going to CD into Jenkins back up LZ here, and we can see now I have a

63
00:04:21,709 --> 00:04:23,660
backup that was successful.

64
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:26,640
Well, that's it for this lecture.

65
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:28,090
We'll see you in the next.
