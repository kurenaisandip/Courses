00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:10,060
When you think about backups on Jenkins really on any system, it's pretty similar.

2
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:17,770
You have full backups, you have snapshots, you have decremental backups, all those different types

3
00:00:17,770 --> 00:00:24,430
of backup styles are available with Jenkins and primarily for the system.

4
00:00:24,430 --> 00:00:29,460
So even though the application is running, the system itself still needs to be backed up.

5
00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:33,310
Now here's the important bit of what to backup.

6
00:00:33,310 --> 00:00:41,650
Now, of course, you should backup everything but the the end all, be all of if these things go away,

7
00:00:41,650 --> 00:00:44,260
you're probably going to lose 90% of your workload.

8
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:49,690
And the primary place is the Jenkins underscore home folder.

9
00:00:49,690 --> 00:00:54,640
Now, in that Jenkins underscore home folder, you're going to have your configuration files, You're

10
00:00:54,640 --> 00:01:00,250
going to figure out XML, which is the configuration of Jenkins, what Jenkins looks like and what does

11
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:00,700
that mean?

12
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:04,989
Well, how you actually have Jenkins set up inside of your environment.

13
00:01:04,989 --> 00:01:08,920
All of those configurations are in those config XML files.

14
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:17,230
And then again under Jenkins underscore home, there's a folder called Jobs, and those jobs are all

15
00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:18,550
of your pipelines.

16
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:26,530
You need to make sure those bad boys are backed up or else you could literally lose every single CI

17
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:32,320
pipeline, every single CD pipeline, all of your work, essentially everything that you use to deploy.

18
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:36,970
So ensure that the Jenkins underscore home folder is backed up.

19
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:40,010
Well, that's it for this lecture.

20
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:41,490
We'll see you in the next.
