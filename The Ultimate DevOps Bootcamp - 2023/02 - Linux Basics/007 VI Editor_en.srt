00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:05,460
In this section, we will learn more about console based text editors and Linux.

2
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:12,840
Earlier in this course, we saw the usage of the CAT command to write and redirect data into a file.

3
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:20,550
While this works well and has its uses, it is a very basic form and offers no additional features and

4
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:26,550
is not feasible when dealing with adding or manipulating large amount of texts or for writing code.

5
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:32,910
In the DevOps and cloud world, you'll be working with a number of Linux servers and most of the time

6
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:39,570
you'll be accessing them remotely using terminal tools and you'll be modifying content in a number of

7
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:42,570
files, configuration files mostly.

8
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:48,060
So getting the basics of VI editor comes in really handy in such cases.

9
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:57,180
There are a number of text editors available in Linux such as VI, Vim, Nano, etc. and in this course

10
00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:00,810
we will look at VI editor, which happens to be the most popular one.

11
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:06,220
VI ed comes installed by default with most operating systems.

12
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:10,600
Run the VI command and specify the file name to open it.

13
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:16,120
The terminal opens the file and you're now inside the VI editor.

14
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:17,020
VII.

15
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:21,900
Ed has two modes of operation the command mode and the insert mode.

16
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:28,350
When you open a file in VI editor, you are by default in the command mode.

17
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:35,400
In this mode you can issue commands to the editor, such as to copy and paste lines or delete a line

18
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:38,850
or a word, or to navigate between lines, etc..

19
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:42,120
But you cannot write contents to the file.

20
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:49,330
To write contents to the file, you must switch to the insert mode to switch to the insert mode.

21
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:51,180
Type lowercase i.

22
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:58,050
Once you are in insert mode, you may modify the file contents as you would normally to switch back

23
00:01:58,050 --> 00:02:01,270
from insert mode to the command mode.

24
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:03,180
Press the escape key.

25
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:08,030
Let's see what operations are available in the command mode.

26
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:15,450
You may move around through the editor using the arrow keys or the keys cage on your keyboard.

27
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:19,350
K to go up H to left J two down and L to the right.

28
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:22,580
To delete a character, press X.

29
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:29,270
Typing D deletes the entire line to copy a line type y y.

30
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:30,570
And to paste it.

31
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:32,150
Type in P.

32
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:39,150
To scroll the page up or down, press the control plus you or DD buttons.

33
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:46,440
Typing in colon takes you to the prompt where you can type in commands to save the changes made to the

34
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:48,840
file and write the file to disk.

35
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:51,450
Use the colon w command.

36
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:54,960
You can optionally specify a file name as well.

37
00:02:55,580 --> 00:03:03,350
To discard any unsaved changes made to the file and quit whim type in colon Q command to save changes

38
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:07,340
and quit type in colon WQ command.

39
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:09,880
So how do you find stuff?

40
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:16,810
For example, I want to find the word off in this file for this type in the command slash off.

41
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:24,710
When you do that, all occurrences of the word off is highlighted and the cursor is positioned at that

42
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:28,610
location to move your cursor to the rest of the occurrences.

43
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:36,020
Press the key and you can continue to press the end key to move the cursor to all future occurrences.

44
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:38,960
Well, that's it for the basics of VI editor.

45
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:43,430
For now, head over to the labs and practice working with VI Editor.
