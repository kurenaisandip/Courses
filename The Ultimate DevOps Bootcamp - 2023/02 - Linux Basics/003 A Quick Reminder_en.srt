Hey, so here is a quick reminder and I hope you don't mind me jumping in like this.

2
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:12,560
I wanted to take a moment to remind you about the importance of staying focused on the labs and videos

3
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:14,300
that are provided in this course.

4
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:20,540
Now, I understand that you may be eager to create your own local setup to practice, but I recommend

5
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:24,530
that you resist that urge until you have completed the course.

6
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:30,020
Our labs and videos are designed to give you a seamless learning experience that will help you gain

7
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:33,170
the most out of the course in the time that you have available.

8
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:38,930
By sticking to the labs and videos provided in the course, you can minimize distractions and interruptions

9
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:42,440
and ensure that you have a clear path from start to finish.

10
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:47,180
And this will help you stay focused on your learning goals and make the most of your time with us.

11
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:52,250
Rest assured, we will provide you with resources to create your own local setup at the appropriate

12
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:53,280
time in the course.

13
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:58,670
For now, let's focus on the labs so you can gain the knowledge and skills you need to succeed.

14
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:00,630
