1
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:06,120
Let us now look at some more Linux commands that will help you get through this course.

2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:11,910
We will start with user accounts to know which user you are.

3
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:14,250
Run the Who am I command.

4
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:17,850
In this case it says you are user Matthew.

5
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:23,580
The ID command gives you more information about the user, such as the user's ID, which happens to

6
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:28,950
be 1001 and the group ID and the groups that the user is part of.

7
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:36,480
To switch from one user to another, you may use the su command su stands for switch user to switch

8
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:37,440
to user.

9
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:41,700
Say Aparna run the su command followed by the user's name.

10
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:45,060
You will then be prompted for the user's password.

11
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:52,620
If you're accessing one system from another system using say, ssh and you want to log in to the other

12
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:59,400
system using a different user than your current user, specify the username before the host name followed

13
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:01,020
by an add symbol.

14
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:06,700
When it comes to performing tasks.

15
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:10,090
Not all users can do all tasks in Linux.

16
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:15,400
Matthew is a regular user and so his access on the system is restricted.

17
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:20,090
Every Linux system has a super user known as the root user.

18
00:01:20,110 --> 00:01:27,310
The root user has no restrictions on the system and can perform any task, which is why in most production

19
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:33,010
environments or enterprise environments, access to the root user is restricted and you will almost

20
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:36,370
never log in to the systems as a root user.

21
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:42,610
Now, as a normal user, what if you wish to perform actions that can only be performed by a root user

22
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:48,490
such as installing and configuring software and services on the system, or viewing certain paths such

23
00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:50,680
as the root directory?

24
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:59,110
A root user can make that possible for a regular user by granting them pseudo privileges, by making

25
00:01:59,110 --> 00:02:02,800
an entry into the ETSI pseudo ers file.

26
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:09,070
So the user is still a regular user but with root privileges.

27
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:16,990
When a regular user is granted pseudo privilege, they can now elevate their permission level and perform

28
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:23,630
tasks that they otherwise couldn't by simply pre fixing a command with the keyword pseudo.

29
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:29,410
They'll be asked for their password and on entering the password the command is executed.

30
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:36,500
When you look through the labs in the rest of this course, you'll work in an environment where you

31
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:38,630
will not have root access.

32
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:42,630
Instead, you will be a regular user with pseudo privileges.

33
00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:48,060
So while making changes to the system, you must remember to use the pseudo prefix.

34
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,780
If not, you will get permission denied errors.

35
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:57,200
So whenever you hit permission denied errors, remember that it could be because you haven't used the

36
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,340
pseudo prefix.

37
00:02:58,790 --> 00:03:03,110
We will be discussing about a lot of commands through the rest of this course.

38
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:10,100
And for the sake of brevity we won't be specifying the pseudo prefix each time on all our slides.

39
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:14,960
So it is assumed that you will use this prefix while working in the labs.

40
00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:20,270
Let us now look at some commands that will help us download files from the internet.

41
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:27,530
At times you will have to download files from the internet such as RPM packages or binary files or images,

42
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:33,290
and you can use use the call command and provide the URL of the file to download the file.

43
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:37,850
Add the dash capital option to save the result to a file.

44
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:41,630
Otherwise it'll just print the file on screen.

45
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:46,970
Another tool that can be used to download files is the W get command.

46
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:55,340
Again, specify the full URL and with the capital O options, specify the name of the file that you

47
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:57,230
wanted to store locally as.

48
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:05,240
At times you may be on a Linux system and may not know what operating system you are on.

49
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:07,380
To know the current OS.

50
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:10,780
Inspect the release files under the C directory.

51
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:17,600
The release files may be named differently based on the operating system, so use a wild card like this

52
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:21,680
to see more details about the OS.

53
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:29,450
View these files by running the CAT command and you can see that in this case it's CentOS version seven.

54
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:31,590
Well, that's it for this lecture.

55
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:35,780
Head over to the labs and practice working with some more commands on the net.
