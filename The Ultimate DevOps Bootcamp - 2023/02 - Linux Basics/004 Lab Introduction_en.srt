Hello.

2
00:00:01,130 --> 00:00:05,720
In this video, I will explain how to access labs part of this course.

3
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:11,690
This course comes with real hands on labs that you can access right in your browser.

4
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:19,760
Unfortunately, Udemy does not have native support for embedding real hands on labs in the course.

5
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:23,450
And that's why these labs are hosted on Code Cloud.

6
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:30,530
Students who purchased this course on Udemy can get access to the labs for free on Code Cloud.

7
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:35,060
You don't have to make any extra payments to access the labs.

8
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:38,510
There is a lecture named Access Labs in your course.

9
00:00:39,730 --> 00:00:42,070
Right before the first lab starts.

10
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:45,490
In the lecture, there is a link to enroll in the labs.

11
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:51,520
Use the link to go to the checkout page on Code Cloud to gain access to the labs for free.

12
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:57,280
If you haven't signed up on the Code Cloud website before, you will need to provide your email address.

13
00:00:57,370 --> 00:01:01,030
A temporary password will be emailed to you so that you can log in.

14
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:08,290
Code Cloud and Udemy are different platforms and unfortunately there is no option available yet to share

15
00:01:08,290 --> 00:01:10,690
the same user accounts between the two.

16
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:15,970
So you must create an account and sign up on Code Cloud to access the labs.

17
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:20,180
Remember your Udemy credentials won't work on code Cloud.

18
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:25,820
If you are accessing through Udemy for business, then your company credentials won't work either.

19
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:28,840
You must create a new account on Code Cloud.

20
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,050
This is something we hope to improve in the future.

21
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:40,320
Once logged in, you can find your course under the courses page.

22
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:44,460
Lab courses start with the term labs in their name.

23
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:52,150
Once the labs are open, use the maximize button to hide the course curriculum to get more space for

24
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:52,840
your labs.

25
00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:57,550
And if you want to see the course curriculum again, click on the same button.

26
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:04,510
And to turn on dark mode, click the theme toggle button in the top right corner of your screen.

27
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:10,169
Once you're done working on a lab market, complete, using the complete button.

28
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:15,900
As you can see, there are multiple lab scenarios for each course and when to access which lab.

29
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:19,260
The detail of that will be given within the course.

30
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:24,570
AS and when you progress through the course on Udemy, you will know when to access what lab.

31
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:26,670
Well, that's it for now.

32
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,260
I wish you all the best.

33
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:33,810
And if you run into issues with accessing labs, please write to support and support at icloud.com.

34
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,870
I hope you have a great learning experience from us.
