00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:06,210
I wanted to share a quick tip about how I think you can maximize the hands on experience and results

2
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:07,770
you gain from this course.

3
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:11,340
So think of this like learning how to build a car.

4
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:17,280
Now, if you start building the car without ever having driven or being in one, you will find it especially

5
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:17,890
difficult.

6
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:24,270
Now, you would have no idea what the wheels, the transmission or electronics are for and how the brakes

7
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:26,830
work or why you need a hand brake and so on.

8
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:32,970
But once you have driven a car for some time, then you'll know the role that all these vital elements

9
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:34,720
play in the function of the car.

10
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:40,890
And then when you learn how to build the car, it will be with a feel for the machine that you are aspiring

11
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:46,830
to build, and you will build it with an actual understanding of the parts that you are putting together.

12
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:54,900
Now, typically most courses out there ask you to set up virtual machines on virtual box or cloud environments

13
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:56,220
at this stage of the course.

14
00:00:56,250 --> 00:01:01,410
However, this takes a lot of time and not to mention the extra time troubleshooting so you can get

15
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:06,960
everything working correctly and even then you may not have access to enough resources on your system

16
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,540
or on access to cloud platforms.

17
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:15,240
And often you will have to clean up your work before you can even begin working on the next course topic.

18
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:21,240
And all of these take away a lot of time when it comes to focusing on the things that actually matter.

19
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:26,660
Now, of course, it's important to learn how to set this up, and you'll learn a lot by troubleshooting

20
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:29,340
and figuring things out for yourself.

21
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:36,920
But repeated issues will discourage some of you, and others will even give up and everyone will miss

22
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:39,860
out on the new skills that they were about to gain.

23
00:01:40,190 --> 00:01:45,710
At the end of the day, all this teaches you is how to provision VMs on your laptop and figure out networking

24
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:46,340
functions.

25
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:50,030
And we have specific courses for this that can be taken separately.

26
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:54,470
And you should, if you want to learn how to set up your own local environments.

27
00:01:54,800 --> 00:02:01,370
However, if your main goal is to learn about the topic that's taught in this course, the best approach

28
00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:06,170
is to spend maximum time gaining hands on experience in this specific topic.

29
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:10,250
And that's exactly why we build our dedicated labs.

30
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:17,000
So my recommendation to you is to go through and aim to complete this course as soon as possible and

31
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,500
to complete it using our labs for the best possible experience and results.

32
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:27,470
Each lab is specifically crafted for the lecture that you learned before, so there is no cleanup needed,

33
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:30,140
no messed up environments, no missing prerequisites.

34
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:35,930
You go from learning something to actually gaining experience in about less than 20 seconds.

35
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:44,040
So protect yourself and your learning journey from distracting issues that are out of your control For

36
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:44,540
now.

37
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:50,520
Contain that urge to set up your own local environments and build your own local system.

38
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:56,850
Once you complete the entire course, you can dedicate your time and focus to setting up your own environments

39
00:02:56,850 --> 00:02:59,100
and working on your own research and projects.

40
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:02,450
And we have a lot of resources to help with that too.

41
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:06,870
And by then you will have all the prerequisite knowledge to build your own environment.

42
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:12,570
And if you do run into issues, you will be in a far better position to resolve them.
