1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:06,720
Let us now look at deploying multiple VMs on VirtualBox and configuring networking between them.

2
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:10,860
We will also look at some cloning and snapshot functionalities.

3
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:17,030
One way to create multiple VMs is to simply clone an existing VM.

4
00:00:17,030 --> 00:00:22,820
So if you plan to create multiple VMs, then it's good to plan ahead so that you could first create

5
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:30,380
a template VM and then just create multiple clones from it to create a clone for an existing VM.

6
00:00:30,410 --> 00:00:33,470
Right Click the VM and select the clone option.

7
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:39,140
Note that for this option to appear, the VM must be powered off.

8
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:41,510
Then give the new VM a name.

9
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:45,470
I'll limit VM two and then select the type of clone.

10
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:50,300
So there are two types of clones a full clone and a linked clone.

11
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:55,530
A full clone creates a full copy of the disk used by the existing VM.

12
00:00:55,550 --> 00:00:58,790
Consuming equal amount of new space.

13
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:06,110
A linked clone uses the disk of the existing VM and only consumes space for the changes made in the

14
00:01:06,110 --> 00:01:06,980
new VM.

15
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:13,970
The only concern is when you plan to move a VM from one system to another in case of the linked clone.

16
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,480
You will have to copy the disk of the original VM as well.

17
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:25,160
Or in case you decide to delete the original VM, you will run into issues as the linked clone has a

18
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:26,270
dependency on it.

19
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:33,560
So if you don't plan to copy your VMs, then linked clone is a good option as it consumes less space

20
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:35,570
on your on your laptop.

21
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:42,010
Okay, so I'll just select the linked clone and continue with it and create the VMM.

22
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:46,360
So we now have two VMs before turning them on.

23
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:47,870
Let us make some changes.

24
00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:51,850
So we want the two VMs to be able to reach each other.

25
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:56,950
So they both must be part of the same network as per the current setting.

26
00:01:56,950 --> 00:02:01,510
They are configured with Nat and so they are isolated from each other.

27
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:08,350
We also want the VMs to be able to reach the Internet as we plan to install software on them.

28
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:16,420
So we will leave adapter one with NAT, that's for the Internet and we will configure a second adapter

29
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:18,120
to connect to a host network.

30
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:21,670
For that we must first create the host network.

31
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:25,060
So go to file and select host Network manager.

32
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:30,480
Our Windows systems should also have this option.

33
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:33,990
Once it's open, create a new network.

34
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:37,050
I already have a network in this case.

35
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:39,000
I'll add a new network.

36
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:41,760
It's named V Box net one.

37
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:45,900
And as you can see, it has an IP address range one 92.1.

38
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:48,000
68.50 7.1.

39
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:55,740
If you'd like the Vrms to get an IP address assigned to them automatically, then check this box and

40
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:57,120
then click close.

41
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:04,610
Then go to the VMS network settings and set the second adapter to connect to host only network and choose

42
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:06,320
the newly created network.

43
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:14,440
Do that for both VMs.

44
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:23,370
Also note that if your system is low on resources, feel free to reduce the CPU and memory on these

45
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:25,290
VMs as necessary.

46
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:29,350
Then power on the VMs and wait for them to boot up.

47
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:37,820
Once they are up log in using the OS boxes dot org user account.

48
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:42,320
I had created a user account named Matthew on one system.

49
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:44,090
That's why you see that there.

50
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:46,280
You can also see that on the other system.

51
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:50,480
And that's because when we cloned it, all the settings get cloned as well.

52
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:58,050
Now, once logged in, open up the terminal and inspect the IP addresses.

53
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:07,910
Here you can see the new interface that was created to connect to the new host only network.

54
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:10,820
It's named NPE zero SE eight.

55
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:15,440
The IP address that got assigned automatically is one 92.1.

56
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:17,480
68.50 7.3.

57
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:21,640
Let us now check on the second system.

58
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:29,120
The second system gets IP one 92.1.

59
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,490
68.50 7.4.

60
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:35,900
And remember, we said that our host is also part of the network.

61
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:43,880
So our host also gets an IP address of one 92.1, 68.50 7.1 on the network.

62
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:51,680
Now they all can reach each other through these IP addresses.

63
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:56,610
We can now SSH to these VMs using these IP addresses.

64
00:04:56,630 --> 00:05:02,270
We don't really need that port forwarding rule we configured in the previous demo anymore.

65
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:05,850
So ssh and use the root password.

66
00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:13,080
And I will use another terminal to SSH to the other VM.

67
00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:24,270
We will also test Internet connectivity.

68
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:30,390
Since we have the first adapter configured for NAT, we have Internet connectivity through that and

69
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:31,890
we see that successful.

70
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:46,360
Now just to test and show you the difference, we'll change the first adapter to use the other host

71
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:49,600
network we had instead of the NAT configuration.

72
00:05:57,210 --> 00:06:03,990
Now, when we check the IP address, we see that it now has another IP on the first interface, which

73
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:05,940
earlier was configured with NAT.

74
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:12,980
And if we try to reach internet now, it is not possible.

75
00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:21,910
So remember that depending on your requirements, you must set up your networking configurations.

76
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:28,000
If you simply want the VM to have internet connectivity, then set it to NAT.

77
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:35,590
Each VM is isolated, if you like multiple VMs to talk to each other and have internet connectivity,

78
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:37,300
choose NAT network.

79
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:43,750
If you want multiple VMs to reach each other, but no internet connectivity, choose host network.

80
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:49,480
In this case, your host will also be part of the same network and can reach the VMs without any port

81
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,170
forwarding.

82
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:56,570
If you'd like the benefits of multiple networking options, then you can have both of these on a single

83
00:06:56,570 --> 00:06:58,400
VM, as we did in this demo.

84
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:03,290
So have one adapter configured to host network and the other adapter with Nat.

85
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:12,620
Now, none of these options really make your VMs visible to the external network, so your VMs are essentially

86
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:13,190
hidden.

87
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:21,450
If you like all of these and also have your VMs visible on the external network, then choose the bridged

88
00:07:21,450 --> 00:07:22,170
option.

89
00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:26,880
Let us now look at the snapshot feature.

90
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:34,050
With the snapshot feature, you can create a snapshot or backup of your VMs state at a particular point

91
00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:38,490
in time and then restore it to that backup at a later point in time.

92
00:07:42,090 --> 00:07:44,910
Let's just pick the first VMM for this demo.

93
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:49,260
Say we have an application or a file created in a directory.

94
00:07:49,410 --> 00:07:57,060
And for example, we create a directory slash opt slash app and under that we create a file named Explorer

95
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:59,730
with the contents and example file.

96
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:03,030
So that's the current good state.

97
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:05,850
Let us now take a snapshot.

98
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:13,050
So click on this option on the VM and under that select snapshots, there should be a similar option

99
00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:16,590
for that on other platforms as well in Windows and Linux.

100
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:18,210
So try to find that out.

101
00:08:19,170 --> 00:08:21,280
Here you can see the current state.

102
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:24,390
Click on the take button to create a snapshot.

103
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:28,020
We will name it the Good state and provide a description.

104
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:31,830
You can now see a good state snapshot created here.

105
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:35,280
Now we are going to simulate a failure.

106
00:08:35,289 --> 00:08:40,840
We will echo some junk data to the file to simulate some kind of corruption.

107
00:08:43,049 --> 00:08:50,040
Okay, Now that we have mixed up our system and lost the original contents of the file, how do we restore

108
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:50,490
it?

109
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:58,020
Go to the snapshots window and right click the snapshot named Good State and select the restore option.

110
00:08:58,610 --> 00:09:03,080
Now the restore option is grayed out because the VM is still up.

111
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:05,150
So let's first shut it down.

112
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:13,400
Now the restored option is available.

113
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:16,330
Click on it to restore state to the snapshot.

114
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:25,340
Once restored start the VMM.

115
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:32,080
We again connect to it and if you go to the opt app path, you see the exemplar TXT file and if you

116
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:35,380
look into its contents you see that it has the right contents.

117
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:36,370
Great.

118
00:09:36,370 --> 00:09:42,130
So this functionality is especially useful when you are testing different software and functionalities

119
00:09:42,130 --> 00:09:48,580
on VMs, for example, before making a major change to your VM, such as upgrading the version of software

120
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:54,250
or packages, you could take a snapshot of the working state to get back to in the future.

121
00:09:54,610 --> 00:09:58,360
You can also clone a new VM from the snapshot.

122
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:03,400
Say you made a lot of changes and something went wrong and you're not sure what that is.

123
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:09,790
And if you'd like to create a new VM from the previous snapshot, that's possible too.

124
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:17,080
So right click the good snapshot and choose clone and then follow the same process we followed earlier

125
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:19,360
to create a new VM from that clone.

126
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,040
Well, that's it for now.

127
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:26,440
I will see you in the next lecture.
