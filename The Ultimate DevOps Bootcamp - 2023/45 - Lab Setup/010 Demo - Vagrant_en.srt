1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:04,740
Let's take a quick demo of Vagrant to download and install vagrant.

2
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:12,600
Go to Vagrant up dotcom, then go to the downloads page and select the right version for your OS.

3
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:15,750
I'm on Mac, so I'm going to select Mac OS.

4
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:21,870
And this works the same on all operating systems, so you can follow the same instructions that I'm

5
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:23,190
following in this demo.

6
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:27,350
Once the executable is downloaded, install it on your system.

7
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:35,960
Once installed, the command vagrant should be available on your system.

8
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:43,430
That is now open up a terminal and create a directory for Vagrant where we will store all our vagrant

9
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:44,480
configurations.

10
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:50,750
We then CD into that directory and we are now ready to deploy a VM using Vagrant.

11
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:57,500
Now remember, you must have the virtual machine provider, which in this case is VirtualBox already

12
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:58,850
installed on the system.

13
00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:00,980
So I already have that.

14
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:05,090
It could also be VMware Workstation or Fusion as well.

15
00:01:05,090 --> 00:01:11,270
So whatever it is that you plan to use, remember it must exist on the system before you actually try

16
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:13,460
to bring up a VM using Vagrant.

17
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:19,130
Now, if it's anything other than VirtualBox, then when you run the background up command, you must

18
00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:22,850
also specify that provider using the provider option.

19
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:27,230
Now we need to find vagrant boxes to deploy.

20
00:01:27,650 --> 00:01:32,720
Searching for vagrant boxes in Google will land you on the vagrant cloud page.

21
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:37,520
And here you can search for various boxes for different operating systems and solutions.

22
00:01:37,550 --> 00:01:39,680
I'll go with CentOS seven.

23
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:45,320
Select that in that CentOS seven page, we see a template for the vagrant file.

24
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:52,220
We could copy this and create a vagrant file by ourself manually, or if we want Vagrant to create that

25
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:53,270
file for us.

26
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:56,190
Go to the new tab and copy the command.

27
00:01:56,210 --> 00:02:02,090
The command is vagrant in it and followed by the name Central seven.

28
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:08,660
All this command does is create a vagrant file with the image set to CentOS seven.

29
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:14,690
If you see the contents of the vagrant file, we see that it is really just a template with all the

30
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:16,190
options commented out.

31
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:20,540
Any line that begins with a hash is commented out.

32
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:24,860
The only line set is the line with the box name.

33
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:45,860
Running the vagrant up command now downloads the image and then creates a virtualbox VM with it.

34
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:00,400
If you open VirtualBox, you can see the VM being created.

35
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:03,970
It takes a while for it to boot up, so give it some time.

36
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:15,900
And once it's booted up, we see the machine booted and the ready message.

37
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:22,980
Now, when you run this vagrant up command and if you were using an environment other than VirtualBox,

38
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:28,560
then this is where you must also specify the provider using the provider option.

39
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:33,540
We can now ssh into the VM using the vagrant ssh command.

40
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:39,600
So even if you are on a windows environment, you don't really need another SSH terminal tool or putty

41
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,370
or anything.

42
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:42,060
This command just works.

43
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:47,220
It also takes care of authenticating you into the VM using SSH keys.

44
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:53,250
We are now in and we can test the version by viewing the ETSI release files.

45
00:03:56,490 --> 00:04:00,060
And I check the status of the VM using the Vagrant Status command.

46
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:03,030
We see it's in a running state to shut down.

47
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:04,130
Run the vagrant.

48
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:04,530
Halt!

49
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:05,220
Command.

50
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:11,340
We now see the status is powered off.

51
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:20,740
Let's now go into the vagrant file and make some changes.

52
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:27,640
If you go all the way to the bottom, we see the VMs resource settings like memory and configuration.

53
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:29,620
It's currently commanded out.

54
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:37,940
If you look at the settings of the VM, we see that it has 512 GB of RAM and one V CPU.

55
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:45,110
Lower resources can increase boot time for the VM, so we'll increase the resources for the VM from

56
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:46,220
the vagrant file.

57
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:53,990
So let's uncomment the memory specification as well as the starting and ending of that block.

58
00:04:54,530 --> 00:05:02,990
Now we will leave the memory to one gbps to provide CPU configuration, used the VB CPU's property and

59
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:05,600
we set it to two CPUs.

60
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:12,060
We can also rename the VM here.

61
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:16,410
Not sure if you notice, but the VM has a random name assigned to it.

62
00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:21,120
And all of these settings can be found in the vagrant documentation page.

63
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:27,570
We save that file and every time you modify the vagrant file for the changes to take effect, you must

64
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:29,850
run the vagrant reload command.

65
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:36,690
We wait for it to boot up and we can see that the VM name is already updated to the name we specified.

66
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:55,890
Go into settings and we see the memory and CPU are set correctly as well.

67
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:08,070
At times when you boot up VMs using the background up command, you might see an error like this.

68
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:10,110
It's a timeout error.

69
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:16,320
What's happening here is that Vagrant starts the VM and waits for it to boot up completely.

70
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:20,760
However, the VM took more time to boot than Vagrant expected.

71
00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:27,030
This could be because the VM is configured with very few resources and it takes a long time for the

72
00:06:27,030 --> 00:06:27,820
VM to load.

73
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:33,870
The VM may end up booting properly eventually, and then you should be able to access the VM as you

74
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:34,800
would normally.

75
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:41,610
But in case you are not sure and you think it's stuck power of the VM using the vagrant hold command.

76
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:54,510
And then go to the vagrant file and you can increase the timeout by adding a property config VM boot

77
00:06:54,510 --> 00:06:56,220
timeout like this.

78
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:29,010
Reloading.

79
00:07:29,010 --> 00:07:36,390
The vagrant file restarts the VMM and the next time vagrant waits longer before throwing an error message.

80
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:42,620
Well, that's a quick introduction to Vagrant, and I hope it will help you set up labs quickly.

81
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,240
If you'd like to learn more about Vagrant.

82
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:50,120
Please let us know and we can probably create a separate course just for Vagrant, because there are

83
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:52,280
so many things that you can do with Vagrant.

84
00:07:52,370 --> 00:07:57,220
You can configure multiple VMs, you can configure scripts as we saw in the lecture.

85
00:07:57,230 --> 00:08:03,920
So it's a very neat tool to really set up a custom lab environment and then save that configuration

86
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,220
so that you can share it with others.

87
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:09,020
Well, that's it for this section.

88
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,000
I will see you in the next.
