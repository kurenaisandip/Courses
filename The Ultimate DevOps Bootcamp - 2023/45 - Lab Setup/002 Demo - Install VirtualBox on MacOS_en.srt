00:00:01,690 --> 00:00:03,550
Hello and welcome to this demo.

2
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:08,050
In this demo, we're going to see how to set up a lab environment.

3
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:10,180
So in our case, we're going to install VirtualBox.

4
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:17,080
So go to VirtualBox dot org and in the website you will have find a link to download the VirtualBox

5
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:17,860
software.

6
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:24,820
In the download page, you will find links to download VirtualBox for specific operating systems and

7
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:31,420
I'm going to download the software once downloaded, run the executable and follow the instructions

8
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:39,490
in the installation Wizard to complete installation after you install Open up the Oracle Virtual Box

9
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:42,130
interface and it will look something like this.

10
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:45,070
Now the next step is to deploy virtual machines.

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,670
In order to do that, you can either create a machine, attach a CD, drive of an operating system,

12
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:57,040
and follow the instructions to install the operating system as we are familiar with.

13
00:00:57,430 --> 00:01:00,640
However, there's also another easy way.

14
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:07,120
There are pre installed pre configured operating system images available on the internet.

15
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:11,980
We could use those to easily deploy as many virtual machines as we need.

16
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:16,400
For this, if you go to the website OS boxes dot org.

17
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:21,940
You will find a lot of pre-installed pre configured images of various operating systems.

18
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:28,570
Go to this site and select the VM images, virtual box images link at the top and then you will be you

19
00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:31,000
will find a list of various different operating systems.

20
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,040
From this we will select CentOS.

21
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:37,290
And then it will take us to the center of this page.

22
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:40,800
Here you can see information on downloading the center image.

23
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:47,010
In our case, we're downloading the VirtualBox image for Center seven and we're downloading the 64 bit

24
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:47,670
version.

25
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:50,460
So remember to download that particular version.

26
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:56,250
It is downloaded as a7z file, which is a compressed file.

27
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:59,560
So you need a software to uncompressed it.

28
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:02,700
Wait for it to finish the extraction process.

29
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:07,690
Once finished if you go into the folder.

30
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:10,979
You will see that there is a folder called 64 bit.

31
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:18,880
And inside that folder you will find a file with the extension VDI that stands for virtual disk, and

32
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:21,340
that is what we will use to create our virtual machine.

33
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:23,950
We're now ready to create a new virtual machine.

34
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:32,080
So we go back into the Oracle virtual box interface, click on New and we fill in the name and operating

35
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:32,740
system.

36
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:37,420
I will now select the type as Linux and click next.

37
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:41,410
In the next here we select a memory size.

38
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:45,490
In the next step, we select the hard disk that we downloaded.

39
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:51,580
So in this case, the default selection is create a virtual hard disk now, but that is not what we

40
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:51,940
want.

41
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:59,440
We already have a pre-built image of a hard disk downloaded, so we're going to specify that select

42
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:06,640
the user, an existing virtual hard disk file option, and click on Browse and Browse to the file that

43
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:11,440
we downloaded and extracted, which is the center is seven file with the VDI extension.

44
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:12,160
Click on.

45
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:12,520
Okay.

46
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,170
And that creates the file.

47
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:19,210
Now, before powering on the template, we will go into settings and make a few more changes.

48
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:27,940
Go to system and we'll increase the CPU to around two.

49
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:36,460
I will now go ahead and power on the system.
