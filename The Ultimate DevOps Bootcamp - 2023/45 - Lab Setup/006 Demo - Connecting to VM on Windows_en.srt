1
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:02,310
Okay.

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:04,050
I'm now at the login prompt.

3
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:09,510
Select the default user, which is the which is O's boxes.

4
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:14,970
Now the password to find out the password for any images downloaded from boxes dot org.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,250
Go to the info section and then you'll see that the username is o's boxes and the password is always

6
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:21,840
boxes dot org.

7
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:25,470
So I'm going to use that password as boxes dot org.

8
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:31,730
I will click on sign in to log in to the centre.

9
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:32,530
A system.

10
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:35,940
I will open up a terminal.

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,250
And typing i f config.

12
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:42,380
The f config.

13
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:43,950
Command.

14
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:48,490
Tells me the IP address currently assigned to the virtual machine.

15
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:53,320
As you can see, it is 190 2.168.1.112.

16
00:00:54,280 --> 00:01:01,870
Now I will open up a SSH terminal to SSH into that virtual machine.

17
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:08,380
Now in my case I'm using a terminal software called as mobile XTERM.

18
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:09,460
I like to use this.

19
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:11,800
This is a free software that is available.

20
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:14,830
You could use any SSH terminal software.

21
00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:16,840
You could simply use putty as well.

22
00:01:17,290 --> 00:01:26,920
So create a new SSH session and specify the IP address, which is 190 2.168.1.112.

23
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:32,770
And the username is Oz Boxes.

24
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:34,340
Click on.

25
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:34,940
Okay.

26
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:42,830
Now we'll specify the password which is Oz boxes dot org and I'm logged in.
