1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:06,210
In this lecture, we will look at the various networking options available within VirtualBox.

2
00:00:06,689 --> 00:00:12,360
Some of the common issues that our students face with respect to VirtualBox is around networking.

3
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:18,030
A lot of our students struggle with understanding the different kinds of networks such as Nat Bridge

4
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:22,890
and host only and what they mean and what type of network to be used when.

5
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:28,830
Also, how do multiple VMs connect with each other and how to troubleshoot issues where you can't reach

6
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:29,900
the Internet.

7
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:32,940
And that's what we will discuss in this video.

8
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:39,720
So before getting into networking and VirtualBox, let us first revise some of the basic networking

9
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:40,530
concepts.

10
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:47,480
Now computer systems like our laptops or servers have different kinds of interfaces or adapters that

11
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:53,270
are used for connectivity, such as wired Ethernet interfaces to connect to a LAN network through a

12
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:59,720
hub or a switch using a cable and wireless interfaces to connect to the network through wi fi.

13
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:06,440
Now, irrespective of how they connect to a network, once they do, they get an IP address assigned

14
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:09,040
either manually or dynamically.

15
00:01:09,050 --> 00:01:15,610
If there is a DHCP server in the environment, an IP address is assigned to an interface.

16
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:21,750
In this case, we have a laptop that's connected using an ethernet cable to a switch in our home.

17
00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:25,950
Once the connection is established, our laptop gets an IP address.

18
00:01:25,970 --> 00:01:33,140
When you run the IP address show command, you see the interface in p0s3 and it has the IP address.

19
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:35,990
One 92.1 60 8.1.5.

20
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:41,510
Now say you have another adapter, a wi fi adapter, and you attach that to the same network, but this

21
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:43,280
time through wi fi.

22
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:48,890
Then that interface gets another IP address assigned to it and can be seen in the output of the same

23
00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:49,550
command.

24
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:54,440
The same laptop now has two separate IP addresses on the same network.

25
00:01:54,450 --> 00:02:00,930
If any other host were to try to reach our laptop, they may do so using any of these IP addresses.

26
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:08,120
So what I'm trying to say is every system, every computer system has different interfaces and it can

27
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:13,970
have multiple such interfaces and adapters to connect to different networks.

28
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:19,250
So it could be the same network, which is which is as it is in this case, but it could be to connect

29
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:20,420
to different networks.

30
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:26,270
And some interfaces have internet connectivity depending on what network they are connected to and the

31
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:27,800
others do not.

32
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:37,020
Once a virtual machine is provisioned in VirtualBox, if you go to the settings of that VM and in the

33
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:41,700
network tab, you will see different networking options to start with.

34
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:43,620
There are four adapters.

35
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:50,130
This means that you can configure your VM to have up to four network connections.

36
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:55,950
Now how you configure those and what do you connect these adapters to is up to you.

37
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:01,470
By default, only the first adapter is enabled and it is attached to NAT.

38
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:04,860
As you can see, there are multiple options available here.

39
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:09,450
Nat bridge adapter host only adapter being some of them.

40
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:12,900
And we will see what these options are next.

41
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:15,930
So let's start with a simple example.

42
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:22,870
Say we have a physical system like our laptop or a PC and it's connected to the network with the address.

43
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:25,630
190 2.168.1.0.

44
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:30,730
So you set an IP for your PC to one 92.1.

45
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:32,680
68 .1. ten.

46
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,900
And we have virtual box on it.

47
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:42,380
Say, for example, A on VirtualBox, we have provisioned multiple virtual machines, so there are four

48
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:43,940
virtual machines provisioned.

49
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:47,510
Now, how do these VMs talk to each other?

50
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:52,490
How do they read systems outside of your PC?

51
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:56,480
Now, as of now, these virtual machines are simply created.

52
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:59,840
They don't have any network or any IP address assigned to them.

53
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:06,020
So if you log in to any of these VMs through their console and try to ping one another, it would fail.

54
00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:11,540
It wouldn't be you wouldn't even know what the IP address is to do a ping in the first place.

55
00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:16,160
So we create a private network within our PC.

56
00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:20,959
It's called as a host only network and has an address.

57
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:23,690
190 2.168.5.0.

58
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:29,330
So we attach the virtual interfaces of the VMs to this network.

59
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:34,160
Now, I'll explain how we do that in a bit, but let me first cover the concepts.

60
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:41,920
So once you attach the interfaces or the virtual interfaces of the VMs to this network, they all get

61
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:46,840
an IP address in the one 92.1 68 five series in that range.

62
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:50,050
So one system gets 190 to 168 5.2.

63
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:53,320
Another one gets 5.3, 5.4 and 5.5.

64
00:04:54,810 --> 00:05:02,280
Our PC is a part of the network, so a virtual interface is created on our PC and connected to the same

65
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:03,000
network.

66
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:07,620
And it gets an IP one 92.1 60 8.5.1.

67
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:14,820
So all the VMs and PC itself are now part of a virtual private host only network.

68
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:21,640
The reason it's called host only is because the connectivity is contained within this host.

69
00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:28,390
All the VMs can reach each other, but they cannot reach the outside world, nor can anyone outside

70
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:31,090
this host reach these virtual machines.

71
00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:35,310
They're all on a private, internal host only network.

72
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:39,910
So how do you create this host only network, and how do you attach VMs to this?

73
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:43,210
To create this host only network on VirtualBox.

74
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:47,520
On Mac, go to file and then host network manager.

75
00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:51,580
You will have a similar option available for Windows and Linux as well.

76
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:53,410
So just find out where that is.

77
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:56,860
Once you go into the host network manager.

78
00:05:57,730 --> 00:06:02,680
Inside the host network manager, create a new network by clicking on the create button.

79
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:09,970
This creates an internal virtual network in our laptop and creates an interface by the name V Box Net

80
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:15,370
zero and assigns our laptop the first IP address on this interface.

81
00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:22,120
Now, if you run the F config command, you see the two IP addresses assigned to my laptop, the 1i21

82
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:29,200
68 1.10 on the internet adapter and 180 to 168 5.1 on the V box net zero adapter.

83
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:33,760
So that's the network, the first network created by VirtualBox.

84
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:37,510
And you can create multiple such host only networks.

85
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:39,870
With within Marshall Box.

86
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:44,050
So now that we have created the network to attach a VM to this network.

87
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:50,670
Go to the settings page of a VM and under network, select the adapter and select attach to host only

88
00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:54,690
adapter and select the new network that we created.

89
00:06:54,810 --> 00:06:57,270
So do that on each VM.

90
00:06:57,270 --> 00:07:06,360
And since this host only network also has DHCP enabled, the VMS get an IP assigned automatically.

91
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:07,500
Okay.

92
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:08,910
So that was one scenario.

93
00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:10,440
Let's look at another option.

94
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:15,120
So say we have another physical machine in the network.

95
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:22,190
So just building off of that previous example where we have on one side we have our host only network

96
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:28,730
and the and the VMs inside it, but we also have another host that's attached to this particular network

97
00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:36,980
and it has an IP 192 168 1.11 The PC has some kind of service running on it, such as, let's say a

98
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:45,740
database instance, for example, and our VMs on the first PC would like to access this particular database.

99
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:52,610
Now, in the current setup with the host only network, the VMs are not going to be able to do that

100
00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:58,700
is because they are on a host only network and they cannot really reach outside of that host.

101
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:02,630
So for this we introduce a NAT network.

102
00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:07,800
So instead of creating a host only network, we create a NAT network.

103
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:13,970
The NAT network is similar to the host only network where, as in we create a private network within

104
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:19,060
the physical system and we attach all the VMs to it and they all get an IP address.

105
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:23,180
But this time these VMs can access the outside world.

106
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:28,040
The VMs can now access the database using its IP address.

107
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:34,909
Now, for every packet that is sent from the VM to the database, the NAT engine which sits on the on

108
00:08:34,909 --> 00:08:43,100
our host is going to replace the source IP with its own IP address so that when the database receives

109
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:47,540
a request, it's going to think that it's all coming from the first PC.

110
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:51,530
It is unaware of the VMs that are present on the first PC.

111
00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:57,740
So it processes the request and sends back the data to the first PC.

112
00:08:58,190 --> 00:09:04,730
The NAT engine on receiving the response, intercepts the packet and changes the address back to the

113
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:08,900
original VMs IP and forwards it back to the VM.

114
00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:16,250
So that's what's called address translation, and that's why network address translation, when a request

115
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:23,750
is sent, the net from address is actually translated to the host address and then the request goes.

116
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:31,190
And then when the response is received, the two address is changed back to the original address of

117
00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:33,740
the VM that in fact send the request.

118
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:39,800
So with this setup, the VMs within can access the outside world.

119
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:46,250
But remember, the outside world is still unaware of the VMs that exist within the system.

120
00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:51,230
So no systems from the outside world can access the VMs inside.

121
00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:53,330
So how do you do that?

122
00:09:53,330 --> 00:09:54,980
To create a net network.

123
00:09:55,010 --> 00:10:03,140
Go to the virtual box preferences page and select network, and there you will find NAT Networks.

124
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:07,220
Click the plus button and create a new NAT network.

125
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:15,740
Once created to attach a VM to this NAT network, go to the VM settings and under network, attach the

126
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:17,930
adapter to NAT Network.

127
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:20,600
Now note that it is different from Nat.

128
00:10:21,290 --> 00:10:23,480
So Nat and Nat Network are different.

129
00:10:23,570 --> 00:10:26,060
And then select the name of the NAT network.

130
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:27,320
And that's all.

131
00:10:28,010 --> 00:10:31,100
So what is Nat and Nat Network?

132
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:35,270
What is the difference between Nat and Network and Nat?

133
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:39,700
NAT is the default setting of a V on virtual box.

134
00:10:39,730 --> 00:10:47,050
It works similar to NAT network as in the VMs can reach the external world and uses NAT network address

135
00:10:47,050 --> 00:10:52,420
translation so that when records go out, they go out with the address of the host, and when responses

136
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:57,350
are received, the address is replaced by the virtual nat router within that VM.

137
00:10:57,370 --> 00:11:02,050
However, you don't have that internal network here.

138
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:06,310
So as such, the VMs are not able to reach each other.

139
00:11:06,310 --> 00:11:13,180
So each VM is isolated, They cannot talk to each other, but they can talk to external systems through

140
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:13,920
the host.

141
00:11:13,930 --> 00:11:20,590
So in this case, each VM kind of gets its own nat router, whereas in the earlier case there was a

142
00:11:20,590 --> 00:11:25,710
NAT network and there was a single nat router that there works for all VMs.

143
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:29,530
In this case, there's more isolation between the VMs within the host.

144
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:31,750
So that was about Matt.

145
00:11:32,170 --> 00:11:39,420
Now let's look at another scenario where an external host requires access to the internal VMs.

146
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:45,910
So we've been talking about internal VMs trying to access external services, but now let's see what

147
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:54,160
happens if we want to external services or external VMs to access internal VMS services or services

148
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,110
running on these internal VMs.

149
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:02,140
So say for example, there is a web application running on one of these VMs and there are other systems

150
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:10,480
that are on our network such as laptops, and these laptops want to access the web server that's running

151
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,820
inside one of these VMs.

152
00:12:13,490 --> 00:12:18,600
So let's look at another kind of network known as a bridge network.

153
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:26,840
The bridge network acts as an extension of the land network, so you don't really have to create a bridge

154
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:32,870
network like how we created the host only network or the net network before the bridge network is always

155
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:35,330
there, so you just have to connect to it.

156
00:12:35,330 --> 00:12:43,160
So once the VMs connect to this network, this time they get an IP address in the same IP range as that

157
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:46,100
of the external land network.

158
00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:51,340
So they are assigned IPS in the range 190 to 168 one series.

159
00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:57,650
And it is as though they are all part of the same external network.

160
00:12:57,670 --> 00:13:02,790
Any device on the network can see them as just another virtual machine on the network.

161
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:08,770
So even though they are within the the the first host there, in fact it is as if they are all part

162
00:13:08,770 --> 00:13:17,530
of the same network because the host also gets an IP address in the range 190 to 168 1.10 and the VMs

163
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:22,720
within the host also get an IP address in the same range, 1.12, 1.13.

164
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:25,420
So it's as if they are all part of the same network.

165
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:29,260
But in fact these VMs are inside this host.

166
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:35,770
So since they are all part of the same network through the bridge network, these laptops can access

167
00:13:35,770 --> 00:13:39,550
any services that are that are run on these VMs.

168
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:43,320
So that's about brain network.

169
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:44,300
Okay.

170
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:48,800
So we've talked about the three kinds of network host only and Nat and Bridge.

171
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:52,940
Let's now talk about Internet connectivity in each of these cases.

172
00:13:54,030 --> 00:14:01,110
In case of a net setup, whether it's a NAT network or just NAT, we learned that internal VMs can reach

173
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:04,200
external network through network address translation.

174
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:13,050
So VMs configured with a NAT interface can reach Internet as long as the host VM has Internet connectivity.

175
00:14:13,290 --> 00:14:15,840
You don't really need to do anything else.

176
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:22,440
The best option, as we know, is an extension of the external network, so it makes the VM as another

177
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:23,640
host on the network.

178
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:29,130
So just like all hosts on a network, the VM should be able to reach the internet easily.

179
00:14:29,130 --> 00:14:33,270
So there's nothing really required over there too.

180
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:39,810
However, in case of a host only network, the VMs are on an internal private network.

181
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:45,480
All VMs attached to that internal network can see each other, but they can't connect to any systems

182
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:47,250
outside of the host machine.

183
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:52,920
The host machine is connected to two networks the internal host only network where the VMs are.

184
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:58,620
There and the external network that has Internet connectivity and that has connectivity to the rest

185
00:14:58,620 --> 00:14:59,700
of the network.

186
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:08,520
So now we can enable the host machine to forward traffic from the internal network to the external network.

187
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:13,230
Now for this you must enable IP forwarding on the host VM.

188
00:15:13,530 --> 00:15:17,820
So this is by default disabled on our laptops.

189
00:15:17,970 --> 00:15:20,640
Most laptops have that that functionality.

190
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:26,850
So enabling the IP forwarding feature essentially makes our laptop a router.

191
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:31,140
So a router that can route traffic one from one network to another.

192
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:35,370
Now, if you think about it, you don't really have to do that.

193
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:39,540
If all you need is to establish Internet connectivity for the VMs.

194
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:45,700
There are other ways to do that, such as by adding an additional adapter to these VMs.

195
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:50,910
Because as we learned earlier, that there are each of these has four adapters, so you can configure

196
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:53,930
a second adapter and attach it to NAT.

197
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:59,280
And that way through those adapters, those VMs will have Internet connectivity.

198
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:02,910
So that's just another additional option.

199
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:05,190
So here's what I was talking about.

200
00:16:05,190 --> 00:16:10,440
So earlier we said that their of each beam can have four adapter, so you can configure the second adapter

201
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:11,790
to be attached to that.

202
00:16:12,830 --> 00:16:19,340
So now when you run into connectivity issues, you know where to look at and you know that you should

203
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:23,420
be looking at the number of interfaces that are configured on the VM.

204
00:16:23,570 --> 00:16:26,060
Look at what type of network they are attached to.

205
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:32,920
Check if those interfaces have IP addresses assigned and you should be able to get a fair idea why you

206
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:35,510
weren't able to reach the Internet.

207
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:40,820
Now, before I let you go, one more thing that's worth mentioning is about port forwarding.

208
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:47,840
So a lecture about VirtualBox networking is incomplete without discussing about port forwarding.

209
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:49,940
So let's look at what that is.

210
00:16:51,570 --> 00:16:57,060
Let's look at a simple scenario where we have a single VM configured with NAT.

211
00:16:57,210 --> 00:17:05,760
The default option Port forwarding allows us to map a port on the host to a port on the guest.

212
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:13,490
For example, Port 80 on the host could be mapped to port 80 on the guest so that any traffic that comes

213
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:18,619
in on port 80 on the host is forwarded to port 80 on the guest.

214
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:26,020
Now maybe the guest is running a web server and it's since it's a not setup, as we discussed before,

215
00:17:26,050 --> 00:17:32,770
external hosts can't reach the VM, so configuring a port forward can help the web server receive requests

216
00:17:32,770 --> 00:17:40,180
from external hosts, even though it's in a setup because the port forwarding forwards traffic from

217
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:42,910
the port on the host to the port on the guest.

218
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:45,250
Now it need not be the same port either.

219
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:49,930
You can map port 8080 to port 5000 on the VM.

220
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:57,250
Earlier we discussed that to SSH into the VM, we assign an IP address and then use that IP address

221
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:59,800
to SSH from the host to the guest.

222
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:09,550
Another way to do that is if you don't know the IP address of the VM and you can map port 22 of the

223
00:18:09,550 --> 00:18:18,880
guest, which is the port used to establish SSH connection to another port say 2222 on the host then

224
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:27,280
you can simply ssh to the loopback IP address of the host and port 2222 and that will in fact forward

225
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:33,430
those requests to port 22 on the VM and you should be able to switch into that.

226
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:39,610
So this way you can have multiple VMs and multiple different services running on them and you can map

227
00:18:39,610 --> 00:18:42,610
those services to ports on the host.

228
00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:50,020
Now this is done under the Veeam network settings and by going into the port forwarding options here,

229
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:57,010
you can see the different rules to map host port to guest port as well as specify the protocols that

230
00:18:57,010 --> 00:18:57,760
are used.

231
00:18:58,180 --> 00:19:02,170
Well, that's it for now and I'll see you in the next lecture.
