00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:03,540
Hello and welcome to this demo.

2
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:08,130
In this demo we are going to see how to set up a lab environment.

3
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:14,530
So in my case, I have a Windows system, so I will be setting up a lab environment on my Windows system.

4
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:17,070
It doesn't really matter what operating system you're on.

5
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:23,820
You could follow the same instructions to set up a lab environment on Linux or your Mac operating systems.

6
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:29,640
So in our case, we're going to install VirtualBox, so go to VirtualBox dot org and in the website

7
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:33,660
you will have find a link to download the VirtualBox software.

8
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:40,110
In the download page, you will find links to download VirtualBox for specific operating systems.

9
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:42,600
In my case, I'm mine is Windows.

10
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:49,290
I'm going to click on Windows and I'm going to download the software once downloaded, run the executable

11
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:54,150
and follow the instructions in the installation Wizard to complete installation.

12
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:58,320
In my case, I've already installed it, so I'm just going to cancel that.

13
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:06,000
After you install open up the Oracle VirtualBox interface and it will look something like this.

14
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:08,940
Now the next step is to deploy virtual machines.

15
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:15,530
In order to do that, you can either create a machine, attach a CD, drive of an operating system,

16
00:01:15,530 --> 00:01:20,900
and follow the instructions to install the operating system as we are familiar with.

17
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:24,500
However, there's also another easy way.

18
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:30,980
There are pre installed pre configured operating system images available on the internet.

19
00:01:31,010 --> 00:01:35,840
We could use those to easily deploy as many virtual machines as we need.

20
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:40,260
For this, if you go to the website OS boxes dot org.

21
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:45,830
You will find a lot of pre-installed pre configured images of various operating systems.

22
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:48,650
Go to this site and select the VM images.

23
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:54,380
VirtualBox images link at the top and then you will be you will find a list of various different operating

24
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:54,860
systems.

25
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:56,930
From this we will select CentOS.

26
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:01,170
And then it will take us to the center of this page.

27
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:04,680
Here you can see information on downloading the center image.

28
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:10,889
In our case, we're downloading the VirtualBox image for Center seven and we're downloading the 64 bit

29
00:02:10,889 --> 00:02:11,540
version.

30
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:14,340
So remember to download that particular version.

31
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:16,650
We will.

32
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:22,050
Then it is downloaded as a seven zip file, which is a compressed file.

33
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:27,830
So you need a software to uncompressed it like guitar or winzip.

34
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:33,150
In my case, I'm using the seven zip software to extract the contents of the file into a folder.

35
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:38,290
Wait for it to finish the extraction process.

36
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:43,300
Once finished if you go into the folder.

37
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:46,560
You will see that there is a folder called 64 bit.

38
00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:56,260
And inside that folder you'll find a file with the extension VDI that stands for virtual disk.

39
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:59,080
And that is what we will use to create our virtual machine.

40
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:01,720
We're now ready to create a new virtual machine.

41
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:09,850
So we go back into the Oracle VM VirtualBox interface, click on New and we fill in the name and operating

42
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:10,540
system.

43
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:17,170
Now I will name the virtual machine that I'm creating as CentOS template because as we discussed, we're

44
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:25,090
our goal is to create a template and then use that template to create as many virtual machines as I

45
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:25,570
need.

46
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:28,360
So I'm going to name it as CentOS template.

47
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:32,860
I will now select the type as Linux and the version.

48
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:38,320
Since it does not have CentOS listed, I could simply select other.

49
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:44,800
Now, as you can see under the versions there are 32 bit as well as 64 bit options.

50
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:51,970
In our case we downloaded the center was 64 bit version, so we must select 64 bit option.

51
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:59,740
Now in case you do not see the 64 bit options in this list, and that is most probably because you do

52
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:06,130
not have the virtualization technology enabled on your laptop to enable virtualization technology on

53
00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:07,060
your laptop.

54
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:10,570
It is usually under the BIOS settings.

55
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:17,440
So if you simply Google enable virtualization in bios followed by your laptop model, you will see a

56
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:18,410
set of results.

57
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:23,960
It's usually usually looks something like this under the BIOS, under the advanced BIOS features.

58
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:30,940
You'll have something called as virtualization technology and you must ensure that it is set to enable

59
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:31,510
state.

60
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:38,150
So once you do that, restart your laptop and you will find the 64 bit option and click next.

61
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:41,960
In the next here we select a memory size.

62
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:49,970
By default, it's set to 512 NB and let's change that to around two GB So we'll set it to two two gigs.

63
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:54,380
In the next step, we select the hard disk that we downloaded.

64
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,780
So in this case.

65
00:04:58,130 --> 00:05:02,330
The default selection is create a virtual hard disk now, but that is not what we want.

66
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:09,830
We already have a pre-built image of a hard disk downloaded, so we're going to specify that select

67
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:17,060
the user, an existing virtual hard disk file option, and click on Browse and Browse to the file that

68
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:21,860
we downloaded and extracted, which is the center is seven file with the VDI extension.

69
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:22,580
Click on.

70
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:22,910
Okay.

71
00:05:22,910 --> 00:05:24,590
And that creates the file.

72
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:29,630
Now, before powering on the template, we will go into settings and make a few more changes.

73
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:37,850
Go to system and we'll increase the CPU to around two and we go to network section and we will set the

74
00:05:37,850 --> 00:05:39,990
adapter one to bridge network.

75
00:05:40,010 --> 00:05:46,700
This way my virtual machine gets an IP address as well as it can connect to the internet to download

76
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:48,770
and install packages as required.

77
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:51,890
I will now go ahead and power on the system.

78
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:05,000
I'm now at the login prompt.

79
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:10,490
Select the default user, which is the which is O's boxes.

80
00:06:10,730 --> 00:06:15,950
Now the password to find out the password for any images downloaded from boxes dot org.

81
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:21,230
Go to the info section and then you'll see that the username is o's boxes and the password is always

82
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:22,820
boxes dot org.

83
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:24,490
So I'm going to use that password.

84
00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:26,420
O's boxes dot org.

85
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,600
I will click on Sign in.

86
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:32,650
To log in to the centre.

87
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:33,520
System.
