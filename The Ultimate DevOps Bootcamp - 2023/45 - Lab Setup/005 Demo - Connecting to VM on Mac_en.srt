1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:06,380
So there are different ways to connect to a Linux VM on VirtualBox depending on how you set up your

2
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:07,220
networking.

3
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:15,020
I used two different approaches while deploying the VMs in Windows and Mac, so I kind of had two demos

4
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:15,980
there, Windows and Mac.

5
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:17,210
You don't have to go through them.

6
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:18,920
It's kind of the same demo.

7
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:24,440
The only difference between the two is that on one I set up a bridge networking and on the other I didn't.

8
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:29,300
So the one on the left, as you see here, is the setting on Mac.

9
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:32,600
And on the one on the right is the setting on Windows.

10
00:00:32,930 --> 00:00:38,720
On the Windows deployment, I added a bridge adapter and on the Mac OS, I didn't.

11
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:43,640
I just configured the default NAT option for the networking adapter.

12
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:51,140
Now if you had configured the bridge adapter as in Windows, the VM becomes part of the external network

13
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:53,800
and it gets an IP address assigned to it.

14
00:00:53,810 --> 00:00:58,970
You can simply SSH to it as you would as a switch to another system in your network.

15
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:05,570
In case of Nat, as in the Mac setup, it doesn't connect to the external network and so does not get

16
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:09,980
an IP address on the external network that we can use to SSH to.

17
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,140
So we will use port forwarding as we discussed in the previous lecture.

18
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:20,340
I also want to point out that this doesn't have anything to do with Windows or Mac.

19
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:25,470
Both these network configurations can be configured on either OS and it works the same.

20
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:29,370
I just chose two different options just to show you the difference between the two.

21
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:32,440
So let's proceed with the connectivity on Mac.

22
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:38,550
Once the system is powered on, if the console looks too small, you can go to the view menu and scale

23
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:40,620
visibility to 300%.

24
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:46,140
There is a welcome screen and wizard within the console, so just go through that and close them.

25
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:57,130
From the application's menu select terminal.

26
00:01:57,150 --> 00:02:04,830
We'll now check the IP address of the system so we type in IP address, show command to see the IP addresses.

27
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,660
As you can see, it gets an IP address of ten .0. 2.15.

28
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:15,960
Now this is a private internal IP assigned by the NAT router for this VM.

29
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:19,160
So this IP is not reachable from anywhere else.

30
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:23,270
Neither the host or nor any other VMs created on this network.

31
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:28,170
So don't try to ping this IP address access to this IP from the host.

32
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:29,730
You'll not be able to do that.

33
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:36,600
If you had multiple VMs, you will see that all VMs configured with Nat are isolated and they all get

34
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:40,350
the same IP address assigned and they cannot reach each other.

35
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:45,690
However, with network address translation, they can reach the external world.

36
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:48,120
So you should have internet connectivity.

37
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:56,220
If your host has Internet connectivity, you can verify that by trying to ping an external website like

38
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:56,760
this.

39
00:02:58,270 --> 00:02:59,710
Okay, so that looks good.

40
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:03,790
So how do you remotely connect to the system?

41
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:11,110
Like, if you want to ssh into this VM to perform, you know, to carry out operations, to run commands.

42
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:12,910
How do you do that?

43
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,800
So first, verify that the SSH service is running for this.

44
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:20,890
Run the service SSH the status command.

45
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,360
We see the status is active.

46
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:28,990
Now our goal is to ssh into this VM from a terminal on our host.

47
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:35,320
Since it doesn't have an IP address that we can ssh to, we will set up port forwarding.

48
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:41,620
Go to the settings menu of this VM and under the network section select port forwarding.

49
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:48,600
Add a new rule.

50
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:54,580
We will forward a port on our local host to a port on the VMM.

51
00:03:54,600 --> 00:04:02,220
The SSH service listens on Port 22 on the VM, but we also have an SSH service on our host that uses

52
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:03,320
Port 22.

53
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:07,310
So we cannot forward 22 on our host to the VM.

54
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:15,210
So we will configure another port, say port 2222 on the host to forward to port 22 on the VM.

55
00:04:15,210 --> 00:04:19,260
So we add a rule for that and we name it as SSH port.

56
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:29,400
Now I could try to switch to my local host IP or a loopback IP address, which is 120 7.0.0.1 and specify

57
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:37,470
port 2222 And if you'd like to log in as route user, specify the username before the IP address and

58
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:41,160
enter the password ohs boxes dot org and you're in.

59
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:46,170
Well, we have now connected to our VM and we can now run any commands.

60
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:52,460
We'll inspect the release files under the ETSI directory, using the CAD command to verify the version

61
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:53,390
of OS.

62
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:57,230
And as we can see that it's CentOS seven.

63
00:04:58,070 --> 00:05:00,020
So we've connected to the right system.

64
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:02,880
So that's it for this demo.

65
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:04,970
I will see you in the next video.
