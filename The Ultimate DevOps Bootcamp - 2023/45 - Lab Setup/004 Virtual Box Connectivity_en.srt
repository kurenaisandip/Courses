00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:05,070
In this lecture, we will look at how to connect to the VM we created in the previous video.

2
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:10,560
Now, some of the most frequently asked questions about setting up a local lab environment revolves

3
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:12,330
around connectivity.

4
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:15,390
How do we connect to the VM and how do we ssh into it?

5
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:21,300
Why can't I access the something that's hosted on the VM such as the web browser?

6
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:25,410
And we'll find answers for these in this video.

7
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:33,720
So on our laptop, which we will call as the host system, we have deployed Oracle VirtualBox and created

8
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:38,460
a VM having CentOS image which happens to be the same.

9
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:44,490
The guest system I'm using Mac, but it works the same for Windows or Linux.

10
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:52,930
Now, when a VM is installed and ready, you can start the VM either in a normal mode or a headless

11
00:00:52,930 --> 00:00:53,470
mode.

12
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:57,640
Now, a normal mode gives you a console to the VM.

13
00:00:57,820 --> 00:01:02,500
You can see the UI of the VM as you would see a Linux laptop boot up.

14
00:01:02,650 --> 00:01:05,220
It's like looking at the monitor of a machine.

15
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:12,370
If the image we downloaded came with a Linux GUI as well, then we can see the UI on the screen and

16
00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:16,390
work with the VM, like working with any other GI.

17
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:24,160
The GI is okay to explore and maybe play around with initially, but when you get into real dev ops

18
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:29,330
and cloud and automation tasks, it would be better to have CLI access.

19
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:36,400
So I personally never used the GI because it's in fact a bit painful to work with switching between

20
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,290
your system and the VM UI.

21
00:01:38,290 --> 00:01:45,580
And since it's a v m, the UI and console may be a bit slow, you can't easily copy and paste stuff

22
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:50,140
from your host to the guests or copy files back and forth.

23
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:53,020
You can, but it's just not that easy.

24
00:01:53,050 --> 00:01:59,800
Now, eventually you need a terminal to work with a Linux system that is to run commands for installing

25
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:02,080
packages, working with services, etc..

26
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:11,290
So instead of using the terminal inside the GI, it is a lot more convenient to use a terminal on your

27
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:12,460
host laptop.

28
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:14,320
In the normal mode.

29
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:18,430
When the console is closed, the VM must be shut down or suspended.

30
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:22,720
It props up this message where it gives you these three options.

31
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:29,230
The first one says Save the machine state, which is suspend and then sent or the other options are

32
00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:31,690
sent a shut down signal or power of the machine.

33
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:36,460
The other option shown here is the head start.

34
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:42,160
So if that is selected, the VM still starts, but the console window won't be opened.

35
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:48,430
The VM can only be accessed remotely using SSH or remote desktop tools for Windows.

36
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:54,970
The third option is where it can be started in a normal mode, but closing the console won't require

37
00:02:54,970 --> 00:02:58,730
you to suspend or shut down the VM.

38
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:04,540
Instead, you have you now have a new option that says continue to run in the background.

39
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:12,870
So that just selecting that option simply closes the console alone and it continues to keep the the

40
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:14,370
VM running in the background.

41
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:20,410
Depending on what OS has been used on the guest system, we have different ways of connecting to it.

42
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:25,900
For example, say we had a Windows system to remotely connect to the Windows system without using the

43
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:26,710
console.

44
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:32,620
You could use the some kind of remote desktop client such as the one provided by Microsoft.

45
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:40,280
Now if the guest has a Linux operating system as it is in case of Santos, we can connect to it remotely

46
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:49,670
through SSH using SSH clients like the terminal app in Linux or Mac and tools like putty in Windows.

47
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:56,030
Although the VMs are within our laptop, think of them as separate machines connected to the same network.

48
00:03:56,180 --> 00:04:02,210
So whatever you need for one system to connect to another system, you would need that here.

49
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:08,030
For this to work, you must have these VMs configured with IP addresses and the relevant services must

50
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:08,660
be configured.

51
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:15,620
And running on Windows, you need the remote desktop service to be running and on Linux you need the

52
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:17,420
SSH service to be running.

53
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:21,680
So make sure SSH server is installed and is in a running state.

54
00:04:21,709 --> 00:04:28,910
If so, you can SSH into the VM from the host system using the terminal on the host and the IP address

55
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:30,230
of the remote VM.

56
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:36,970
But how do you configure set service and IP addresses on the VM if you can't connect to it on the first

57
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:37,580
place?

58
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:42,040
For that, you could use the console to perform initial configuration.

59
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:48,820
It's a common practice to use the console to perform initial configurations and then once SSH is enabled,

60
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:51,970
switch over to the terminal for all future interactions.

61
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:59,220
So if you run into issues connecting to a VM check to make sure that the VM has an IP address set and

62
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:05,670
that you are using the right IP address and that SSH service on the remote VM is running.

63
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:12,270
So here's a quick example on how to check or set IP addresses in a centralized machine.

64
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:18,850
Run the IP address, show command, and it lists all interfaces and IP addresses assigned to them.

65
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:24,480
The first interface is the loopback interface with the IP.

66
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:31,740
120 7.0.0.1 and the second interface is zero, which is the interface used for connectivity.

67
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:35,970
And it has IP addresses one 92.1 68 or 1.10.

68
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:42,930
Now, if the IP address was not set, you can set the IP using the IP address, add command and specify

69
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:49,500
the IP address followed by the subnet mask and the device you want to set the IP on, which happens

70
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,630
to be e zero in this case.

71
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:58,710
Now, with different operating systems, the device names as well as commands may differ.

72
00:05:58,710 --> 00:06:05,910
So refer to the operating system documentations and find out the right relevant way to set IP address.

73
00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:09,240
And here's a quick tip on checking the SSH service.

74
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:16,890
The SSH service comes by default with sent OS image to check if the daemon is running.

75
00:06:16,890 --> 00:06:17,190
Run.

76
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:19,740
The service has saved status command.

77
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:22,810
If it's not running, run the service.

78
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:26,500
Ssh the start command to start it.

79
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:28,500
Well, that's it for now.

80
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:31,280
We will now head over to a demo and see this in action.

81
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:36,860
And in the upcoming lectures, we will discuss more about networking in VirtualBox.
