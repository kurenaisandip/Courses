00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:04,410
Hello and welcome to the Ultimate DevOps Bootcamp course.

2
00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:10,030
If you have been procrastinating about starting your DevOps journey, this is the perfect time and the

3
00:00:10,030 --> 00:00:11,170
perfect course.

4
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:15,760
My name is Chad Monomyth, and me, along with my fellow instructors, will be assisting you through

5
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:16,510
this course.

6
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:22,150
In this course you'll not just learn theory, but you'll learn by doing with the help of our hands on

7
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:22,780
labs.

8
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:28,480
Every topic is followed by a hands on lab created specifically for that topic to help you gain hands

9
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:29,410
on experience.

10
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:36,590
If you're an absolute beginner, we'll start with the basic prerequisites on systems administration

11
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:38,000
like Linux and networking.

12
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:43,100
Ultimately, I.T. and DevOps is there to serve applications to end users.

13
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:47,450
And if you started your career on the infrastructure side of things, and if you have been a person

14
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:52,640
who hated coding and development, then you might find it especially difficult to follow some of the

15
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:58,820
concepts in DevOps, like what's front end and back end in a software, What are APIs, what's a build

16
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:03,500
process, what is packaging, what are dependencies, what are environment variables, etc. So although

17
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:08,420
you don't have to learn coding, it's good to have some idea about these from the perspective of a few

18
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:10,640
of the most popular programming languages.

19
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,050
So that's what we see next.

20
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:14,480
We see the basics of Java, Node.js, Python.

21
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:16,700
Again, there is no coding or programming involved.

22
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:21,470
We will only see how to take an application written in these languages and what are the necessary steps

23
00:01:21,470 --> 00:01:23,810
required to build and host them in a server.

24
00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:30,200
Developers collaborate on Git and Git is kind of at the center of DevOps pipeline or infrastructure

25
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:30,740
as code.

26
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:33,650
So Git I would say is the most important piece to learn.

27
00:01:33,650 --> 00:01:39,350
So we have a short module on that and we then move on to containers and Docker and container orchestration

28
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:40,280
with Kubernetes.

29
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:46,070
Now many DevOps tools like Ansible, Docker and Kubernetes use YAML files to define configurations.

30
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:51,950
So understanding the basics of YAML is a must and you will learn YAML with a set of hands on exercises.

31
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:55,460
Now we learn about microservices architecture.

32
00:01:55,460 --> 00:02:01,520
After this, we then move on to learning automation tools like Ansible and TerraForm, and finally we

33
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:02,810
learn about Python.

34
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:08,750
Now it's important to learn at least one programming language and you learn all of this by doing so

35
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:14,360
together you can stack up hundreds of hours of hands on experience by the time you're at the end of

36
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,140
this course.

37
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:19,910
If you run into any issues.

38
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:26,540
We have a thriving community to support you and we are so sure you'll benefit from our courses that

39
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:28,520
we offer a 30 day money back guarantee.

40
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:30,260
So there is nothing for you to lose.

41
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,760
I'm very excited to get started and I will see you in the first lesson.
