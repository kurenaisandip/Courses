1
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:08,280
You know, when you're logging into, I don't know, some site maybe it has a little bit of so so you

2
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:14,970
can connect and log in via like your Gmail or your GitHub or another type of email service, something

3
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:15,750
like that.

4
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:17,580
Well, that's a connection.

5
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:25,380
It allows you to connect from one service to another or it allows you to connect with one service to

6
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:26,120
another.

7
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:28,560
And that's essentially what plugins are.

8
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,500
Plugins allow you to connect to other services.

9
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:37,230
So for example, let's say you want to connect to Azure from Jenkins.

10
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:42,720
Well, you would download an Azure plug in, you would have it in your pipeline and then that would

11
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:49,530
be able to allow you to connect to Azure at a programmatic level and it allows you to ultimately easily

12
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:51,180
work with other products.

13
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:57,960
So for example, let's say you want to use Jenkins for the build process and you want to use, I don't

14
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:02,760
know, GitHub actions or another pipeline tool for the deployment.

15
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:03,960
You could absolutely do that.

16
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:08,520
You can do the builds via Jenkins and then send those builds to GitHub actions.

17
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:13,920
So in this section we're going to talk all about plugins, how to search for plugins, how to install

18
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,400
plugins in Jenkins, how to do everything plugin related.

19
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,650
So with that, let's go ahead and jump right in.

20
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:22,940
Well, that's it for this lecture.

21
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:24,390
We'll see you in the next.
