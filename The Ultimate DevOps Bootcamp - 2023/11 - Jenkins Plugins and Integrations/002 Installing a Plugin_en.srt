1
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:09,810
So remember in the video when we were installing Jenkins, we had that option to install the basic plug

2
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:13,390
ins, like the recommended plug ins, and then we could install other plugins.

3
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:15,870
Well, that's one way to install plugins.

4
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:19,800
But after Jenkins is actually deployed, how do we install plugins?

5
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:22,200
Well, we do that with.

6
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:24,780
The plugins index.

7
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:29,190
So there are so many different plug ins that are available.

8
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:34,920
Jenkins You've got to remember, Jenkins has been around for, I believe, over a decade now.

9
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:41,880
And because of that and because of its popularity, there's always going to be plug ins available for

10
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:42,330
Jenkins.

11
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:44,910
So if we go ahead and we look at plug ins.

12
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:51,660
Jenkins I o and we search for, I don't know, maybe Azure, we can see here that there are a bunch

13
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:52,890
of different plug ins available.

14
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:58,620
So if you want to manage Azure credentials using the Jenkins Credentials API, you can do that.

15
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:05,099
If you want to work with the Azure SDK API, you can do that Azure ad, you can do that Azure VM agents,

16
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:07,770
you can do that Azure CLY, you can do that.

17
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:08,820
You get my point.

18
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:14,550
There is a bunch of different ways that you can do this and then there are other plugins available as

19
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:14,790
well.

20
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:17,550
So like eight of us, there are a ton of plugins.

21
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:21,630
Let's look at maybe Python, there's a ton of plugins here as well.

22
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:27,330
Let's look up, I don't know, Golang, there's one plug in here that automatically installs and sets

23
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:27,780
up.

24
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:31,560
Go for the tools for the build agents, which we're going to get into.

25
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:37,800
But think of build agents like they're the things that run your pipeline essentially depending on your

26
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:38,310
platform.

27
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:41,190
So maybe you want to run a c i C platform for Mac OS.

28
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:43,140
Anyways, don't worry about that right now.

29
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:44,820
We're going to absolutely get into it.

30
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:51,030
But the point being is there are so many different plug ins that are available now.

31
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:53,880
How do we actually install those plug ins?

32
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:58,260
Well, that's it for this lecture we'll see in the next.
