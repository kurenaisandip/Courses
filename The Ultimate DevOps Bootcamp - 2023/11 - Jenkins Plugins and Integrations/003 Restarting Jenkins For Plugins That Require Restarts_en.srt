1
00:00:04,330 --> 00:00:10,120
There's going to be plug ins that you can install without restart or you could download now and install

2
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:10,920
after restart.

3
00:00:10,930 --> 00:00:18,670
So some plug ins may need you to restart your Jenkins instance, but not all of them will require you

4
00:00:18,670 --> 00:00:19,750
to ultimately do that.

5
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:22,450
So I wouldn't really worry about it all that much.

6
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:32,740
But if you need to, of course we could always just do sudo system CTL restart Jenkins.

7
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:38,960
And then what that's going to do is that's going to restart our instance of Jenkins.

8
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:41,500
We can do system CTL status.

9
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:45,130
Jenkins Now we can see that it is up and running, which is great.

10
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:47,540
But if I just go ahead and I refresh here.

11
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:54,100
We'll see that Jenkins is restarting right now and the services are just coming up.

12
00:00:55,990 --> 00:00:58,480
And then now we can log back in.

13
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:03,660
So that's essentially how you restart.

14
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:10,110
Jenkins If you need to for a new plug in that's getting installed or anything else, really.

15
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:11,820
Well, that's all for now.

16
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:13,530
Let's get some hands on practice.
