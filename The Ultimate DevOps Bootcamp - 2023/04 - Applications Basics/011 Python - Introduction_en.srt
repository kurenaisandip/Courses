00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,780
In this section, we will look into the basics of Python.

2
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:11,910
Python is a free and open source cross-platform compatible programming language as we discussed before.

3
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:19,080
Once the application is developed, Python requires the python interpreter to run the application.

4
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:25,770
To download python interpreter, go to the downloads page on the Python website and download the Python

5
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:27,870
installer for your operating system.

6
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:33,650
Now, it's important to note about the two different versions of Python.

7
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:41,840
Version two was released in the year 2000 and its development ended in the year 2010, and Python version

8
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:47,240
three was initially released in the year 2008 and continues to be developed today.

9
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:54,140
Python three introduced considerable changes with respect to improvements and fixes from Python two

10
00:00:54,740 --> 00:01:00,770
that programs written in Python two required a lot of changes to be made to run in Python three.

11
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:08,090
Python three did not guarantee backward compatibility with its predecessor, so applications had to

12
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:11,960
be carefully migrated or ported to Python three.

13
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:20,000
So remember that applications developed in Python two must be run on a python two interpreter and applications

14
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,830
written in Python three must be run in a python three interpreter.

15
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:32,660
Python three also introduced a whole set of new features which pave the way to support modern technologies

16
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:36,590
such as machine learning, data science and artificial intelligence.

17
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:43,760
Some operating systems come pre-installed with Python, so run the Python two or Python three commands

18
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:47,450
to verify if it's installed properly.

19
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:52,220
If not instal python using the yum installed python command.

20
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:59,330
Note that python two is available with the package named python two and python 3.6.

21
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,990
Version is available as python three six.

22
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:08,270
You can have both versions of python installed on the same system at the same time.

23
00:02:08,539 --> 00:02:15,170
Once installed to invoke the python two interpreter, simply run the python two command and to invoke

24
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:17,300
the python three interpreter.

25
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:19,580
Simply run the python three command.

26
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:27,710
You will then be inside the interpreter where you can type in python commands and work with Python.

27
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:32,030
And if you want to exit out of that mode type exit.

28
00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:33,140
To come out of it.

29
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:40,910
Note that some Python installations may also have installed as just Python without the version.

30
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:49,420
And Python without any version in the command line usually defaults to the whatever version was first

31
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:49,960
installed.

32
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:54,490
Sometimes it could be Python two, or it could be Python three.

33
00:02:55,160 --> 00:03:01,670
To get the full version of installed Python run the python command for the respective version followed

34
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:03,920
by the Dash v option.

35
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:06,260
The V is in capital letter.

36
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:12,620
So here you can see that the Python two version is 2.7.16.

37
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:15,710
And Python three version is 3.6.8.

38
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:22,780
To run a python program, use the python command followed by the program name.

39
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:28,870
In this case, we have a simple Hello world program running the Python command, followed by the program

40
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:32,410
name runs the program and prints the message.

41
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:42,930
Well, head over to the labs and work with installing Python and run a sample application in Python.

42
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:49,020
And in the next lecture we will talk about dependencies and builds in in Python.
