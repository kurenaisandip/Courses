1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,330
In this section, we will look into the basics of Java.

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:10,170
Java, as you know, has been one of the most popular programming languages widely used for building

3
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:13,200
desktop, mobile and web applications.

4
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:17,770
It is free and open source and has a huge community following and support.

5
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:24,810
The latest version of Java as of this recording is version 13, and these are some of the previous versions

6
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:26,310
and the year they came out.

7
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:33,090
In your work environment, you might find a lot of applications dependent on different versions of Java,

8
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:37,920
and it's not unlikely to see a lot of organizations stuck at version eight.

9
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:45,150
Version nine introduced changes that made many popular tools and libraries incompatible at the time

10
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:49,320
of the release, which prevented many companies from upgrading their infrastructure.

11
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:55,770
So these, along with some of the changes in licensing terms, resulted in many applications being stuck

12
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:57,870
at version eight of Java.

13
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:05,060
You may download and install Java on your platform from the Oracle website on Linux machines like Central

14
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:06,980
West, which we will be using in our lab.

15
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:14,600
Download the Java build and using a utility like we get and extract it to a directory.

16
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:20,340
The bin directory within the extracted folder has all the java binary files.

17
00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:25,080
To check if java is installed on a machine or to check the version of Java.

18
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:29,370
Run the Java command with the version option.

19
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:33,810
As you can see, the current version is 13 .0.2.

20
00:01:34,690 --> 00:01:41,890
Now, it's important to note that older versions of Java before version eight also referred to the version

21
00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:45,220
numbers as 1.8 instead of just eight.

22
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:49,840
So that was the original version naming scheme in the past.

23
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:52,150
So this changed with version nine.

24
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:58,190
So don't get confused with the two types of version names up until version eight.

25
00:01:58,210 --> 00:02:02,140
It was known as 1.5, 1.6, 1.7 and 1.8.

26
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:06,760
But from version nine onwards it changed to nine, ten, 11, 12, 13, etc..

27
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:07,870
Now.

28
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:15,020
We thought we were talking about Java, but what's all the JDK that we see here?

29
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:17,870
So the release page says JDK availability.

30
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:20,570
The downloaded files are named JDK.

31
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:22,670
The version says Open JDK.

32
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:24,920
So what's what's a JDK?

33
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:29,030
JDK stands for Java Development Kit.

34
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:35,480
It is a set of tools that will help you develop, build and run Java applications on a system.

35
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:38,090
So you don't really install just Java.

36
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:44,930
You install a kit or a set of tools that helps to all three to develop a Java application.

37
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:51,650
You can really just use any text editor to write the code, but once you do to debug your application,

38
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:57,470
you have the Java debugger tool to document your application source code.

39
00:02:57,470 --> 00:03:00,000
You have the Java doc tool.

40
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:06,230
Once the source code is developed to build and compile your application, you have the Java Sea tool

41
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:12,410
and the JAR Tool helps archive the code and related libraries into a single jar file.

42
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:20,280
Now we will talk more about how this build process works and see it in action in the upcoming lectures.

43
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,980
Once built to run the Java application, you need the Java runtime environment.

44
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:32,070
A Java runtime environment is needed to run a Java application on any given system.

45
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:39,970
In fact, that's the only component you need to simply run a build Java application on any system.

46
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:47,460
And of course, you also need the Java command line utility or the loader that is used to run the application.

47
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:53,910
So all of these and many other tools together form the Java development kit.

48
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:58,110
So these tools are commands available in the bin directory.

49
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:07,020
When you install Java and what we have listed here are just a few of the many tools included within

50
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:08,040
the JDK.

51
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:15,540
It's important to note that in the past, before version nine of Java, JDK and Java were shipped as

52
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:16,709
separate components.

53
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:20,459
So back then you could install these components individually.

54
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:26,850
And so if you were not really developing a Java application and just wanted to run an existing, fully

55
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:33,000
built application, you could simply just install the Java runtime environment alone and run the application.

56
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:37,680
You would see separate directories of installation for each of these.

57
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:45,600
From version nine onwards, both JDK and GRC are packaged together into a single Java development kit

58
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,260
package.

59
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:52,530
So when you install JDK, you will install all tools as well as the Java runtime environment.

60
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:57,950
Well, we will now head over to the labs and our practice working with.

61
00:04:58,810 --> 00:04:59,290
Java.

62
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:04,220
So you'll basically be having multiple systems and you'll install Java.

63
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,920
You'll explore the different versions of Java.

64
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:08,860
You'll run basic Java programs.

65
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:13,480
And in the next lecture, we'll continue with builds in Java.
