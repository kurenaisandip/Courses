00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:04,530
In this section, we will look into the basics of a Node.js application.

2
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:09,270
Before talking about Node.js, let me quickly introduce JavaScript.

3
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:18,270
So in the past websites looked like this playing with mostly just text links and probably some images.

4
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:23,910
It was built with basic HTML code and some CSS to style it.

5
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:31,530
JavaScript is the technology that drives modern web development from a plain text website.

6
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:41,160
JavaScript allowed us to build websites that are intelligent and interactive, such as building calculators,

7
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:48,900
fun animations, games, graphs, running predictions on the web, running mathematic, mathematics

8
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:56,670
calculations, etc. So JavaScript made it possible to develop web pages that can almost do anything

9
00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:01,050
that you can really think of today that you can do on a web page.

10
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:08,610
JavaScript paved the way for different client side frameworks like jQuery, Angular, JS, React, JS,

11
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,060
Vue.js, Enbridge's Backbone, JS, etc..

12
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:16,680
But remember, all of these are client side technologies.

13
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:23,250
That is, they're used to build web pages that would eventually run on clients or users systems like

14
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:24,180
our laptops.

15
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:29,430
They didn't actually have anything to do with the application server itself.

16
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:37,560
In the past server side code or the back end code, as you call it, was mostly only on Java or Python

17
00:01:37,690 --> 00:01:38,520
Ruby.

18
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:46,110
So you had one of these on the server side and then you'd have a JavaScript based framework that would

19
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:48,750
run on the client side in the browsers.

20
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:54,720
Node.js took JavaScript out of the web browsers and onto the server side.

21
00:01:54,900 --> 00:02:01,920
Node.js is a server side JavaScript environment that can be used to develop applications such as Web

22
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,050
servers using JavaScript.

23
00:02:04,410 --> 00:02:11,760
An important feature that distinguishes Node.js from others is its ability to handle a large number

24
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:16,380
of concurrent connections by implementing a non blocking i o model.

25
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:22,950
Now Node.js is open source and free and it's compatible with different platforms like Windows, Linux,

26
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:25,500
Unix, Mac OS, etc..

27
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:28,560
Here are the different versions of Node.js.

28
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:32,430
As of this recording, the latest version is 13.

29
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:38,310
To install Node.js, follow instructions in the Node.js documentation site.

30
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:46,290
The node source repository contains binary distributions for all different Linux flavors.

31
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:50,500
So we will look at an example for CentOS here on CentOS.

32
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:58,440
First, add the repository for Node.js and then use the YAML, install Node.js command to to install

33
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:58,830
it.

34
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:01,450
Once installed successfully.

35
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:07,330
Node is the command line utility run the node v command to list the node version.

36
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:14,080
So if you're given an application written in Node.js as you see it here on the right, then to run it,

37
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:17,650
simply run the node command followed by the file name.

38
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:25,150
As I was saying, working with the code inside of these application files are out of scope for this

39
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:25,510
course.

40
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:27,820
So we're not really going to look into coding.

41
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:34,510
Our focus is understanding how to deploy a Node.js application when given a set of code and not really

42
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:36,240
read through and understand the code itself.

43
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:38,230
So that's it for this lecture.

44
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:45,340
Head over to the labs and practice working with the basics of installing and running a simple node application.

45
00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:47,200
And I will see you in the next lecture.

46
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:51,370
We will where we will talk more about Node.js and packages.
