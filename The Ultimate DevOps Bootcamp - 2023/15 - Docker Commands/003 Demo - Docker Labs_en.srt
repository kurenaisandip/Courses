00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:04,880
Let me now walk you through the hands on lab practice environment.

2
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:11,410
The links to access the labs associated with this course are available at Code Cloud.

3
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:16,180
At Code cloud dot com slash P slash Docker Dash Labs.

4
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:19,430
This link is also given in the description of this video.

5
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:26,770
Once you're on this page, use the links given there to access the labs associated to your lecture.

6
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:32,860
Each lecture has its own lab, so remember to choose the right lab for your lecture.

7
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:35,860
The labs open up right in your browser.

8
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:40,240
I would recommend to use Google Chrome while working with the labs.

9
00:00:40,690 --> 00:00:46,330
The interface consists of two parts a terminal on the left and a quiz portal on the right.

10
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:50,060
The quiz portal on the right gives you challenges to solve.

11
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:54,880
Follow the quiz and try and answer the questions asked and complete the tasks given to you.

12
00:00:55,450 --> 00:01:01,330
Each scenario consists of anywhere from 10 to 20 questions that needs to be answered within 30 minutes

13
00:01:01,330 --> 00:01:02,140
to an hour.

14
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:03,620
At the top.

15
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:05,420
You have the question numbers below.

16
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:07,820
That is the remaining time for your lab.

17
00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:09,320
Below that is the question.

18
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:11,700
If you are not able to solve the challenge.

19
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:14,030
Look for hints in the hand section.

20
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:19,760
You may skip a question by hitting the skip button in the top right corner, but remember that you will

21
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:23,690
not be able to go back to a previous question once you have skipped.

22
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:31,310
If the Quest portal gets stuck for some reason, click on the quiz Portal tab at the top to open the

23
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:33,290
quiz portal in a separate window.

24
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:41,980
The terminal gives you access to a real system running docker.

25
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,470
You can run any Docker command here and run your own containers or applications.

26
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:51,570
You would typically be running commands to solve the task assigned in the quiz portal.

27
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:57,030
You may play around an experiment with this environment, but make sure you do that after you've gone

28
00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:02,280
through the quiz so that your work does not interfere with the tasks provided by the quiz.

29
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,530
So let me walk you through a few questions.

30
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:07,970
There are two types of questions.

31
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:14,480
Each lab scenario starts with a set of exploratory, multiple choice questions where you're asked to

32
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:19,190
explore and find information in the given environment and select the right answer.

33
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:22,250
This is to get you familiarized with the setup.

34
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:28,790
You're then asked to perform task like run a container, stop them, delete them, build your own image,

35
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:29,540
etc..

36
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,160
Here.

37
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:36,140
The first question asks us to find the version of Docker server engine running on the host.

38
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:41,180
Run the Docker version command in the terminal and identify the right version.

39
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:44,690
Then select the appropriate option from the given choices.

40
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:53,350
Another example is the fourth question where it asks you to run a container using the radius image.

41
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:58,980
If you're not sure of the command, click on hints and it will show you a hint.

42
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:03,490
We now run a Redis container using the Docker run Redis command.

43
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:05,080
Wait for the container to run.

44
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:08,640
Once done, click on check to check your work.

45
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:11,830
We have now successfully completed the task.

46
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:17,050
Similarly, follow along and complete all tasks once the lab exercise is completed.

47
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:20,170
Remember to leave a feedback and let us know how it went.

48
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:25,840
A few things to note These are publicly accessible labs that anyone can access.

49
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:32,770
So if you catch yourself locked out during a peak hour, please wait for some time and try again.

50
00:03:33,490 --> 00:03:38,800
Also remember to not store any private or confidential data on these systems.

51
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:46,210
Remember that this environment is for learning purposes only and is only alive for an hour, after which

52
00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:47,470
the lab is destroyed.

53
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:49,420
So does all your work.

54
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:55,910
But you may start over and access these labs as many times as you want until you feel confident.

55
00:03:56,150 --> 00:03:59,150
I will also post solutions to these lab quizzes.

56
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:02,090
So if you run into issues, you may refer to those.

57
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:03,670
That's it for now.

58
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:07,850
Head over to the first challenge and I will see you on the other side.
