1
00:00:02,430 --> 00:00:10,990
There are obviously a ton of different tools out there, free paid enterprise.

2
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:11,880
All of that stuff.

3
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:15,120
There's a ridiculous amount nowadays, So why?

4
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:22,380
Jenkins Well, we're going to go over these bits, but I want you to think open source a ton of plugins

5
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:24,140
completely free.

6
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:28,260
And if you want to pay a little bit of money, there are some enterprise options as well.

7
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:37,890
So first things first, Jenkins itself, the full CI CD suite, all of the plugins, the ability to

8
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:45,180
deploy it, the ability to host it yourself, it is all 110% free.

9
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:48,660
You can host it on a VM, on a container.

10
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:51,960
You could even host it locally for development purposes if you want.

11
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:58,560
I wouldn't recommend for production purposes hosting it on your Mac or on your Windows device, but

12
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:00,230
you could if you wanted to.

13
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:04,310
And again, you don't have to pay anything to actually use the software.

14
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:05,820
This is open source.

15
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:07,920
This is 100% free.

16
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:09,820
Next.

17
00:01:09,910 --> 00:01:16,930
There are a ton of plug ins, specifically 1000 plus plug ins, which to be honest.

18
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:22,850
Is definitely a lot more than a lot of other platforms, and there's a good reason for that.

19
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:25,830
Jenkins has been around for a really long time.

20
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:32,580
People have created a ton of plugins for it, primarily because remember it is open source and because

21
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:37,920
it's open source, you can create all of the different plugins for it whenever you want to.

22
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:44,250
And with all of the plugins you pretty much going to have a plugin for every major DevOps tool, public

23
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:50,400
cloud provider programming language like Go and Python if you need support for it, it's all there.

24
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:51,960
And if it's not, guess what?

25
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:52,650
It's open source.

26
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:53,820
You could create yourself.

27
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:58,920
Now if you want enterprise like you want support, you want a number to call.

28
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:01,650
You want the ability to not have to host it yourself.

29
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:04,830
You want it more like a SAS style platform.

30
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:08,460
Enterprise options for Jenkins are available.

31
00:02:09,389 --> 00:02:13,050
Well, that's it for this lecture we'll see in the next.
