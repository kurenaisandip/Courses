1
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:10,410
So now that we know a little bit about what it is, why Jenkins is a great free option, let's actually

2
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:11,720
talk about Jenkins.

3
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:15,870
So I am here at the Jenkins web page right now.

4
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:20,770
You could go to w w w dot Jenkins i o and see the same thing that I'm seeing.

5
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:24,870
So first things first, we have the mascot here.

6
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:29,640
I always thought this was quite funny, you know, it's like a butler type of thing, but it makes sense,

7
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:29,970
right?

8
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:35,550
The Jenkins mascot is a butler and by definition, secede is doing the work for you.

9
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:35,850
That's.

10
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:37,020
That's the whole idea here.

11
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:43,400
We're taking the manual tasks out, that manual effort, and we're giving it to secede.

12
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:48,840
So when we're at the Web page here and by the way, I just I'm going to click on a few of these things

13
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:53,070
here, and we're going to go into depth with plug ins and all that good stuff.

14
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:54,330
So this is just a high level.

15
00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:56,730
If you don't already know it, don't worry about it.

16
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:59,640
We will be going through all of that inside of this course.

17
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:06,810
So first things first, we have the blog here, and this is a blog that goes into everything that's

18
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:10,290
happening inside of Jenkins today, vulnerabilities.

19
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:15,690
We have some how to guides like use containers as build agents, all of that fun stuff.

20
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:22,640
Next, we have a documentation and Jenkins documentation is actually really, really solid when you

21
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:27,810
click on installing Jenkins, for example, and we got a bunch of stuff here, let's say maybe we click

22
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:34,260
on Docker and we have all of the documentation needed to install Jenkins via Docker, the prerequisites

23
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:38,940
that are needed, installing Jenkins using Mac OS and Linux.

24
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:39,870
We keep going here.

25
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:41,730
We got all the commands that are needed.

26
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:47,550
So the documentation for Jenkins, it's definitely some of the best documentation that I've worked with

27
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:48,540
so far.

28
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:54,270
Next we have plugins, so plugins again, we're going to go through this, but plugins are a way for

29
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:57,870
you to connect with Jenkins to other systems.

30
00:01:57,870 --> 00:02:04,860
So for example, if we just search Azure here, we can see that there are several different plugins,

31
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:11,340
but for example, maybe you want to use the Azure Cloud or the A-Z CLI to run any type of automated

32
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:12,930
tasks in Azure.

33
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:14,460
Well, there's a plugin for that.

34
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:20,910
You can use the Azure CLI with Jenkins, just like there are a ton of different other plugins, things

35
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:27,270
like for Azure App Services, Key Vault, Azure Container Services or HCI, a whole bunch of good stuff.

36
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:33,540
Next we have community and of course this is extremely important.

37
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:39,750
We have things like meetups contributing to writing the code, any help that's needed documentation

38
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:43,320
testing, connecting to the world about Jenkins.

39
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:51,840
There is obviously a vast community of Jenkins users, engineers, managers, all of that good stuff,

40
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,850
and this is where you could find those people.

41
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:54,510
Next.

42
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:59,760
If we click on Subprojects, we can see a few different other projects that Jenkins is working on as

43
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:00,300
well.

44
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:04,590
Things like Jenkins configuration as Code Jenkins area meetups, right?

45
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:06,810
So that would be under community and all that.

46
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:13,500
And then of course we have the about security press, we have the roadmap here which tells us exactly

47
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:15,480
what's happening with Jenkins.

48
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:20,970
So in short, if you want to get started with Jenkins, which we of course are in this course, but

49
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:26,100
if you want to get started on your own, play around anything, This is the place to do it, to chat

50
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:30,450
with the community, to find any plugins that are needed, any documentation.

51
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:34,260
This is all where you need to start and you don't have to go anywhere else.

52
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:36,610
You can stay right at Jenkins dot I.

53
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:41,490
Oh well, that's it for this lecture we'll see in the next.
