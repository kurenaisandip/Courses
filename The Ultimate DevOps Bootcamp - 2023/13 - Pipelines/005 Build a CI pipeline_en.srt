1
00:00:08,450 --> 00:00:09,350
All right, everybody.

2
00:00:09,350 --> 00:00:14,140
Now that we know how to build a sample pipeline, we know all of the options available.

3
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:20,270
Let's actually dive in and build our code and test it for the first time.

4
00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:25,520
So the first thing that we're going to do is we're going to go to manage Jenkins.

5
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:29,070
And then I'm going to go to manage plugins.

6
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:34,510
Now, I actually already have this plugin installed, but you will need to go ahead and you will need

7
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:36,250
to install it yourself.

8
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:39,610
So search for go.

9
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:47,100
And as you can see, I have this go plug in here, but you can just go to available search for go and

10
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:48,150
you should see a pop up.

11
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:51,530
You're just not seeing it here because I already have it installed.

12
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:56,790
Now, once you have that, you're going to have to restart Jenkins.

13
00:00:56,790 --> 00:01:00,950
So go ahead, restart Jenkins and then come on back.

14
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:01,350
All right.

15
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:05,700
Now, once you're back, let's go ahead and start configuring our pipeline.

16
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:10,680
So first things first, we're going to type pipeline and we're going to go in and we're going to use

17
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:11,790
our brackets here.

18
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:17,480
Now we're going to use Agent Annie because we haven't set up our new build agent yet, which is again,

19
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:18,530
is perfectly fine.

20
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:20,480
We will get there, I promise.

21
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:28,340
And then we're going to type tools, new opening, closing bracket, and then we're going to type go

22
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:34,450
for go line, and then we'll do go hyphen 1.17.

23
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:41,420
Now, this is the latest in terms of when I'm recording this course right here, but it may be different

24
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:41,990
for you.

25
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:45,590
If you have a newer version, feel free to pop that one in.

26
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:47,010
Okay.

27
00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:50,360
Next, what we're going to do is we're going to set up our environment.

28
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:52,790
So we're going to type environment.

29
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:59,360
Now we're going to type go 111 module equals on.

30
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:05,780
Now, if you're not familiar with this, essentially what this means is you can install the latest version

31
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:08,660
of some code base from, say, GitHub, for example.

32
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:10,650
Okay.

33
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:13,560
Now, next, we're going to set up our stages.

34
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:17,090
So let's go ahead and set up our stages here.

35
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:24,390
We're going to type stage and we're going to type test in here because our first stage will be our tests.

36
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:26,310
And what do I mean by that?

37
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:29,040
What I mean is we're going to be running some unit tests on our code.

38
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:32,640
So I'm going to type in steps.

39
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:40,140
And then our first step is going to be to bring down the code very much like we did right here.

40
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:47,890
We're going to literally paste that same thing in there, and then we're going to run a shell command

41
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,110
and we're going to say, Go test, dot, dot, dot, dot.

42
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:59,320
What this means is it looks at the current directory and all of the subdirectories and runs every test

43
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,280
that's available.

44
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:03,290
So with that, I'm going to go ahead and copy this.

45
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:05,320
We're going to head back over to Jenkins.

46
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:08,800
And then now let's go to Dashboard new item.

47
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,840
We'll call this go three.

48
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:14,740
We'll click on Pipeline, Click select here.

49
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:19,720
And then we'll go ahead, we'll scroll down to Pipeline and we'll pop our pipeline in.

50
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:23,980
So again, what this is doing is it's using GO version 1.17.

51
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:27,160
We're ensuring that the go 111 module is on.

52
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:31,830
We are setting up a one stage for running our unit test.

53
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:34,630
So let's go ahead and let's save that.

54
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:36,610
Let's click build now.

55
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:40,960
And hopefully our code will build successfully.

56
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:43,140
Okay.

57
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:47,260
And as we can see, our code finish testing successfully.

58
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,880
We can go ahead and we can take a look at the logs here.

59
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:56,250
We can see our shell script and we can see that there are no test files in these repositories.

60
00:03:56,250 --> 00:04:03,540
But in the controller repository here, we can see that there were tests and they all pass successfully.

61
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:06,920
Well, that's it for this lecture.

62
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:08,370
We'll see you in the next.
