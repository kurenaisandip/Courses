1
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:10,090
All right, everybody, now that we know the proper PSI process and how to build our code using Jenkins,

2
00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:15,040
let's go ahead and learn the CI CD process, as in let's go ahead and build our code.

3
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:20,740
Bring it down from GitHub and create a Docker image.

4
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:25,480
So you're going to notice here that our Jenkins file is pretty similar.

5
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:30,100
How is the same pipeline structure using the same tools, the same environment variable?

6
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:35,260
Even that development stage is still the same where we're bringing down the go code.

7
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:40,810
Now really the biggest difference is on line 19 here where we have a new stage called Building Our Image.

8
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:45,910
Now we're using this command from the Docker plugin and I'm going to show you how to get that in just

9
00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:46,780
a second here.

10
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:52,480
But what this is doing is it's going to be building a Docker image based on the code that we're bringing

11
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,640
down on line 14.

12
00:00:54,670 --> 00:00:58,810
So let's go ahead and head over to our Jenkins instance and we're going to go ahead and we're going

13
00:00:58,810 --> 00:01:00,100
to run this Jenkins file.

14
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:00,700
All right.

15
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:02,920
So I'm here at Jenkins.

16
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:07,810
And what I'm going to do first is I'm going to go to manage Jenkins and I'm going to go to manage plugins.

17
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:12,850
Now, if I go to install here, I'm going to do is I'm just going to search Docker.

18
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:18,490
You're going to see a few that I have here, the Docker API plug in the Docker Commons, plug in the

19
00:01:18,490 --> 00:01:21,280
Docker pipeline, plug in, and then the Docker plugin.

20
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,730
You're going to want to ensure that you have all of those installed and you're going to want to ensure

21
00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:30,460
that you have Docker installed on your build server, which in this case is just the Jenkins server.

22
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:34,180
So let's go ahead and go back to Jenkins.

23
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:35,860
We're going to go to new item.

24
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:37,170
We're going to give this a name.

25
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:38,980
Now I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to click Pipeline.

26
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:39,220
Click.

27
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:42,670
Okay, Scroll down to my pipeline script.

28
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:45,710
I'm going to paste in what I just showed everybody on Vee's code.

29
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:47,800
Notice here how it's the exact same.

30
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,530
Let me go ahead and I'm going to click Save.

31
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,450
I'm going to click Build now.

32
00:01:52,930 --> 00:01:58,390
And now our pipeline is going to officially kick off and we have our few stages here.

33
00:01:58,390 --> 00:02:04,600
We can see our development stage and our building, our image stage and as you can see, it is already

34
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:05,380
complete.

35
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:09,370
It's probably going to be a little bit longer for you because you probably don't have the go Docker

36
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:11,230
image installed locally.

37
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:15,250
And because I was testing this out already, I already have that.

38
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:19,230
So if you notice that's taken a little bit longer, that's perfectly normal.

39
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:25,960
But if I click on our build here and I click on our console output, we can see that our code was brought

40
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:31,990
down and then we can see that our Docker image was successfully built.

41
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:34,980
Well, that's it for this lecture.

42
00:02:34,990 --> 00:02:36,430
We'll see you in the next.
