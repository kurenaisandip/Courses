00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:10,770
In the previous video So far, you've seen how to test your code, how to pull it down from GitHub,

2
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:11,820
how to build it.

3
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:18,100
But we haven't exactly seen what it looks like to fully run the code.

4
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:23,880
So what we're going to do right here is I'm actually going to take out line 22.

5
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:27,210
And what we're going to do is we're going to have three stages.

6
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:28,850
The first is going to be the test.

7
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:30,540
Second is going to be build.

8
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:33,060
Actually, this should be just build here.

9
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:34,770
And then the third stage is run.

10
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:40,320
So this test stage and the build stage, we've kind of already seen that where we built our code, really

11
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,990
where we want to focus is the run stage.

12
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:44,460
So on line 24 here.

13
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:47,310
Notice how I have this directory.

14
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:52,080
Now, by default, all pipelines are under this workspace directory.

15
00:00:52,530 --> 00:01:01,140
And then what I'm doing is I'm actually calling upon the Go web app sample build and that build actually

16
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:04,739
gets there by line 21 here.

17
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:07,890
So without line 21, this build wouldn't exist.

18
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:14,610
But because we're ultimately able to build our code and it all goes to the same place, we're then able

19
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:18,430
to call upon our go binary here.

20
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:22,020
So what I'm going to do is go ahead and I'm going to copy this.

21
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:24,940
We're going to head over to the Web browser.

22
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:30,720
And then what I'm going to do is I'm going to go into my pipeline right here.

23
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:32,730
And this pipeline is already created.

24
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:35,460
So go ahead and just create this pipeline.

25
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:37,470
Just call it go full pipeline.

26
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:44,130
If you call it something else, just keep in mind that you will have to change the name here on line

27
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:44,850
26.

28
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:46,860
Now, that's the name of my pipeline.

29
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:49,200
So I was able to get this going.

30
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:55,290
Next, I'm going to go to configure here and this is just going to be a standard build pipeline.

31
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:59,970
And then what I'm going to do is I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to run our pipeline now.

32
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:01,770
So go ahead and I'll build this.

33
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,130
And we'll click on our 18 build here.

34
00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:09,560
As you can see, I've been playing around with this a little bit.

35
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:12,260
Now I'm going to go to my console output.

36
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:15,050
Now let's take a look at what's actually happening here.

37
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:21,560
First, I'm running my tests and as you can see, a lot of these directories don't have tests, but

38
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:23,860
the controller directory does.

39
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:25,120
And these tests ran.

40
00:02:25,130 --> 00:02:29,060
They were all good and passed successfully, which is great.

41
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:31,830
Next, we're going to scroll down here.

42
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:34,770
We see our build process occurring.

43
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:41,500
Scroll down a little bit more and we can see here that our pipeline did in fact finish successfully.

44
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:46,930
So I'm going to go here and I'm just going to take my IP address of my Jenkins host.

45
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:49,150
Pop that in.

46
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:55,030
And as we can see, our application is up and running over Port 8000.

47
00:02:55,480 --> 00:03:02,770
Now, one thing that I do just want to point out, I'm not sure why this occurs, but it says go web

48
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:04,910
app sample not found.

49
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:11,470
I actually even saw this on, for example, if I go to one of my previous builds that finished successfully.

50
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:17,350
If I just go to the console output here and I scroll down, notice how it does say the same thing,

51
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:20,770
but the application is in fact running successfully.

52
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:24,480
It's time for some hands on practice.
