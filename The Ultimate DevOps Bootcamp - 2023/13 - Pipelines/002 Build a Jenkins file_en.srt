1
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:09,140
All right, everybody, now that we understand what Jenkins files are, let's actually dive into some

2
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:12,280
hands on goodness and start to play around with some Jenkins files.

3
00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:13,910
So first things first.

4
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:18,600
If you want to create a Jenkins file, at least in V's code, it's pretty straightforward.

5
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:23,480
Just create a new file and literally just type Jenkins file.

6
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:28,820
And as you can see, V's code knows that this is a Jenkins file, which is awesome.

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,680
So let me go ahead and I'm going to delete that.

8
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:36,080
And then what we're going to do is we're going to look at three separate Jenkins files.

9
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:38,600
Now, we will not be deploying them right now.

10
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:42,020
I just want to show you the structure and the overall basics.

11
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:46,760
And then in the next few videos, we're going to actually look at deploying these Jenkins files.

12
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:51,400
So first things first, I'm going to click on the Jenkins file test.

13
00:00:51,410 --> 00:00:53,240
I'm going to open up this Jenkins file.

14
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:58,820
Now, this is a very straightforward Helloworld Jenkins file.

15
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:03,710
As we can see, we're first set up with our pipeline structure.

16
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:09,020
And our pipeline structure has an opening bracket and it has a closing bracket.

17
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:15,050
And inside of that opening and closing bracket, like, for example, if I just take this out really

18
00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:19,430
quick, we can see that I'm specifying the agent and the agent.

19
00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:22,490
Again, we're going to talk about build agents in the next section.

20
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:26,540
But this could be anything, any type of system that's running Java.

21
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:29,360
I'm saying any here at this point.

22
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:35,360
And what that's going to do is it's actually going to run the current Jenkins server as the build agent.

23
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:40,580
Next, we have our stages that are set up now, our stage.

24
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:43,540
We could have any type of stage that we want.

25
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:46,190
Dev, UAT, prod, we can name it whatever we want.

26
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:51,650
If we want to be a little bit more flush with our names here, we can go out and we can name this dev

27
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:56,020
and then the dev stage is going to deploy some steps.

28
00:01:56,030 --> 00:02:03,500
Now the steps are inside of these brackets here and what this step is doing, it's very straightforward.

29
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:08,840
It's running an echo, which just means it's just going to say something back to us, say something

30
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:11,180
to the terminal that's going to say Hello world.

31
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:16,280
And just like that, you could have your first pipeline set up very, very straightforward.

32
00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:20,540
Next, let's break into something a little bit more complicated here.

33
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:20,930
Go ahead.

34
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:27,410
I'm going to close out of this Jenkins file and then I'm going to open up go app one stage, this directory

35
00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:27,920
here.

36
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,990
Then I'm going to click on this Jenkins file.

37
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:35,270
Now, notice it's pretty much set up the same.

38
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:37,670
We have our pipeline structure.

39
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:40,430
We have our agent that we're calling upon.

40
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:44,930
We have our stages and then we have our step.

41
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:48,920
Now, here's the thing that's actually happening.

42
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:52,750
We're pulling code from GitHub now.

43
00:02:52,760 --> 00:03:03,110
So now what this is doing is this is taking code from GitHub and it's building it for us inside of this

44
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:03,820
pipeline.

45
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:09,770
It's taking this code, it's pulling it from GitHub, and now we'll have that code readily available

46
00:03:09,770 --> 00:03:14,300
to start working on to be able to do things like run tests, for example.

47
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:22,110
And then finally, if we just look into one more thing here, we looked at one stage, let's look at

48
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:22,920
multi stage.

49
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:25,410
Remember we talked about multi stage a little bit already.

50
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:28,440
So as you can see, again, same thing.

51
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:36,360
We have our pipeline structure set up where designing this to say use any agent and then we have two

52
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:36,960
stages.

53
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:42,000
Now this is where things are a little bit different inside of our stages.

54
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:51,030
BLOCK We have two stage keywords, and then within those two stage keywords, we have two different

55
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:51,960
stages.

56
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:59,250
We have one called dev on line five, and then we have one called UAT on line 12.

57
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:06,930
Now within each of those stages, within the dev stage and then within the UAT stage, we have steps.

58
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:10,010
And both of these steps are doing the same thing.

59
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:14,780
This isn't meant to be, you know, a crazy, hardcore advanced example here.

60
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:18,800
This is really just a show how a multi stage pipeline would work.

61
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:23,660
And realistically, this actually does make sense because remember, when you're running multi stage

62
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:29,390
pipelines, you're not necessarily looking to do different things at each stage.

63
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:33,050
You're really looking to do practically the same thing.

64
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:37,970
You want to be able to build the code and you want to be able to test the code and push that code out

65
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:39,320
and all of that good stuff.

66
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:43,130
So if you're looking to set up multi stage pipelines, this is the way that it would look.

67
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:50,660
You would have inside of your stages bracket, you would have two or three or however many stage keywords.

68
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:54,970
Within those stage keywords you would have what stage like Dev or UAT.

69
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:57,490
And then within there you would have your steps.

70
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:02,870
Now remember, just going back one more time, if you want one stage, this is what it looks like.

71
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:08,210
Again, you have your stages bracket, you have your stage keyword, but you're just setting up one

72
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:09,140
stage.

73
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:14,180
So with that, now let's head over to the Jenkins portal and we can actually start building out some

74
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:14,720
code.

75
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:17,980
Well, that's it for this lecture.

76
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:19,450
We'll see you in the next.
