1
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:06,300
Going off of where we just were.

2
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:09,270
Let's go ahead and go back to configure.

3
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:14,940
Now, I'm going to scroll down here and what I want to do is I want to create a new stage.

4
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:17,670
So I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to copy this.

5
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:23,250
And then I'm actually going to just paste that in here.

6
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:27,930
And then we'll do is we'll change this to UAT.

7
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:30,750
So if you've guessed it by now, you are correct.

8
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:30,990
Yes.

9
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:33,560
We just created a multi stage pipeline.

10
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:34,470
Very straightforward.

11
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:36,870
Of course, the step is just echoing Hello World.

12
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:39,820
But I do just want to show this in action here.

13
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:44,400
So if I click on Save and then I click on Build now.

14
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:50,970
We can see that we have now two stages here.

15
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:56,080
We have one stage called Dev, and then we have another stage called UAT.

16
00:00:56,110 --> 00:01:03,040
So when we build our multi stage pipelines, we'll have the ability to see both right here.

17
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:07,690
And we could also even see that this was the third build that was run.

18
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:12,010
But if we look at the second one, there was no UAT stage yet.

19
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:16,930
However, the history of the one just dev running is still here, which is great.

20
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:22,540
So we can see the history of even when it changed from single to multi stage.

21
00:01:23,110 --> 00:01:25,300
Well, that's it for this lecture.

22
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:26,740
We'll see you in the next.
