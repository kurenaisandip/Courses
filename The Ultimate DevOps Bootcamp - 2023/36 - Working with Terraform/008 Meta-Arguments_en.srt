00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:04,950
In this lecture, we will take a look at meta arguments in TerraForm.

2
00:00:06,470 --> 00:00:13,310
Until now, we have been able to create single resources such as a local file and a random pet resource

3
00:00:13,310 --> 00:00:14,450
using TerraForm.

4
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:21,740
But what if you want to create multiple instances of the same resource, say three local files, for

5
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:22,460
example?

6
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:28,610
If we were using a shell script or some other programming language, we could create multiple files

7
00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:29,570
like this.

8
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:37,690
In this example, we have created a Bash script called Create Files SE, which uses a for loop to create

9
00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:39,940
empty files inside the root directory.

10
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:45,580
The files will be called pet, followed by the range from 1 to 3.

11
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:52,370
While we cannot use the same script as it is within the resource block, TerraForm offers several alternatives

12
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:53,870
to achieve the same goal.

13
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:59,500
Now, these can be done by making use of specific meta arguments in their form.

14
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:05,850
Meta arguments can be used within any resource block to change the behaviour of resources.

15
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:10,840
We have already seen two types of meta arguments already in the scores.

16
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:17,630
That depends on for defining explicit dependency between resources and the lifecycle rules, which define

17
00:01:17,630 --> 00:01:21,680
how the resources should be created, updated and destroyed within TerraForm.

18
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:28,610
Now let us look at some more meta arguments specifically related to loops in TerraForm.
